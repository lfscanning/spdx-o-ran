            "description": "Package securejoin implements a set of helpers to make it easier to write Go\ncode that is safe against symlink-related escape attacks. The primary idea\nis to let you resolve a path within a rootfs directory as if the rootfs was\na chroot.\n\nsecurejoin has two APIs, a \"legacy\" API and a \"modern\" API.\n\nThe legacy API is SecureJoin and SecureJoinVFS. These methods are\n**not** safe against race conditions where an attacker changes the\nfilesystem after (or during) the SecureJoin operation.\n\nThe new API is made up of OpenInRoot and MkdirAll (and derived\nfunctions). These are safe against racing attackers and have several other\nprotections that are not provided by the legacy API. There are many more\noperations that most programs expect to be able to do safely, but we do not\nprovide explicit support for them because we want to encourage users to\nswitch to [libpathrs](https://github.com/openSUSE/libpathrs) which is a\ncross-language next-generation library that is entirely designed around\noperating on paths safely.\n\nsecurejoin has been used by several container runtimes (Docker, runc,\nKubernetes, etc) for quite a few years as a de-facto standard for operating\non container filesystem paths \"safely\". However, most users still use the\nlegacy API which is unsafe against various attacks (there is a fairly long\nhistory of CVEs in dependent as a result). Users should switch to the modern\nAPI as soon as possible (or even better, switch to libpathrs).\n\nThis project was initially intended to be included in the Go standard\nlibrary, but [it was rejected](https://go.dev/issue/20126). There is now a\n[new Go proposal](https://go.dev/issue/67002) for a safe path resolution API\nthat shares some of the goals of filepath-securejoin. However, that design\nis intended to work like `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH)` which does not fit the\nusecase of container runtimes and most system tools.",

            "description": "Package restful , a lean package for creating REST-style WebServices without magic.\n\nA WebService has a collection of Route objects that dispatch incoming Http Requests to a function calls.\nTypically, a WebService has a root path (e.g. /users) and defines common MIME types for its routes.\nWebServices must be added to a container (see below) in order to handler Http requests from a server.\n\nA Route is defined by a HTTP method, an URL path and (optionally) the MIME types it consumes (Content-Type) and produces (Accept).\nThis package has the logic to find the best matching Route and if found, call its Function.\n\nThe (*Request, *Response) arguments provide functions for reading information from the request and writing information back to the response.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go with a full implementation.\n\nA Route parameter can be specified using the format \"uri/{var[:regexp]}\" or the special version \"uri/{var:*}\" for matching the tail of the path.\nFor example, /persons/{name:[A-Z][A-Z]} can be used to restrict values for the parameter \"name\" to only contain capital alphabetic characters.\nRegular expressions must use the standard Go syntax as described in the regexp package. (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n(c) 2012-2015, http://ernestmicklei.com.

            "description": "Package restful , a lean package for creating REST-style WebServices without magic.\n\nA WebService has a collection of Route objects that dispatch incoming Http Requests to a function calls.\nTypically, a WebService has a root path (e.g. /users) and defines common MIME types for its routes.\nWebServices must be added to a container (see below) in order to handler Http requests from a server.\n\nA Route is defined by a HTTP method, an URL path and (optionally) the MIME types it consumes (Content-Type) and produces (Accept).\nThis package has the logic to find the best matching Route and if found, call its Function.\n\nThe (*Request, *Response) arguments provide functions for reading information from the request and writing information back to the response.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go with a full implementation.\n\nA Route parameter can be specified using the format \"uri/{var[:regexp]}\" or the special version \"uri/{var:*}\" for matching the tail of the path.\nFor example, /persons/{name:[A-Z][A-Z]} can be used to restrict values for the parameter \"name\" to only contain capital alphabetic characters.\nRegular expressions must use the standard Go syntax as described in the regexp package. (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package. By default restful\nuses the standard library `log` package and logs to stdout. Different logging packages are supported as\nlong as they conform to `StdLogger` interface defined in the `log` sub-package, writing an adapter for your\npreferred package is simple.\n\n(c) 2012-2015, http://ernestmicklei.com.

            "description": "Package logr defines a general-purpose logging API and abstract interfaces\nto back that API.  Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,\nwhile callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.\n\nLogging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with\nmethods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main\nmethods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()\nare key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing\n\"structured logging\".\n\nWith Go's standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr's structured logging, we'd write:\n\nErrors are much the same.  Instead of:\n\nWe'd write:\n\nInfo() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that\nLogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional\ninformation (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are\nalways logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error\ninstance available, passing nil is valid.\n\nOften we want to log information only when the application in \"verbose\nmode\".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.\nThe higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.\nLog-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not\nbe written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same\nmeaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).\nError messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.\n\nWhere we might have written:\n\nWe can write:\n\nLogger instances can have name strings so that all messages logged through\nthat instance have additional context.  For example, you might want to add\na subsystem name:\n\nThe WithName() method returns a new Logger, which can be passed to\nconstructors or other functions for further use.  Repeated use of WithName()\nwill accumulate name \"segments\".  These name segments will be joined in some\nway by the LogSink implementation.  It is strongly recommended that name\nsegments contain simple identifiers (letters, digits, and hyphen), and do\nnot contain characters that could muddle the log output or confuse the\njoining operation (e.g. whitespace, commas, periods, slashes, brackets,\nquotes, etc).\n\nLogger instances can store any number of key/value pairs, which will be\nlogged alongside all messages logged through that instance.  For example,\nyou might want to create a Logger instance per managed object:\n\nWith the standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr we'd write:\n\nLogger has very few hard rules, with the goal that LogSink implementations\nmight have a lot of freedom to differentiate.  There are, however, some\nthings to consider.\n\nThe log message consists of a constant message attached to the log line.\nThis should generally be a simple description of what's occurring, and should\nnever be a format string.  Variable information can then be attached using\nnamed values.\n\nKeys are arbitrary strings, but should generally be constant values.  Values\nmay be any Go value, but how the value is formatted is determined by the\nLogSink implementation.\n\nLogger instances are meant to be passed around by value. Code that receives\nsuch a value can call its methods without having to check whether the\ninstance is ready for use.\n\nThe zero logger (= Logger{}) is identical to Discard() and discards all log\nentries. Code that receives a Logger by value can simply call it, the methods\nwill never crash. For cases where passing a logger is optional, a pointer to Logger\nshould be used.\n\nKeys are not strictly required to conform to any specification or regex, but\nit is recommended that they:\n\nThese guidelines help ensure that log data is processed properly regardless\nof the log implementation.  For example, log implementations will try to\noutput JSON data or will store data for later database (e.g. SQL) queries.\n\nWhile users are generally free to use key names of their choice, it's\ngenerally best to avoid using the following keys, as they're frequently used\nby implementations:\n\nImplementations are encouraged to make use of these keys to represent the\nabove concepts, when necessary (for example, in a pure-JSON output form, it\nwould be necessary to represent at least message and timestamp as ordinary\nnamed values).\n\nImplementations may choose to give callers access to the underlying\nlogging implementation.  The recommended pattern for this is:\n\nLogger grants access to the sink to enable type assertions like this:\n\nCustom `With*` functions can be implemented by copying the complete\nLogger struct and replacing the sink in the copy:\n\nDon't use New to construct a new Logger with a LogSink retrieved from an\nexisting Logger. Source code attribution might not work correctly and\nunexported fields in Logger get lost.\n\nBeware that the same LogSink instance may be shared by different logger\ninstances. Calling functions that modify the LogSink will affect all of\nthose.",

            "description": "Package mux implements a request router and dispatcher.\n\nThe name mux stands for \"HTTP request multiplexer\". Like the standard\nhttp.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of\nregistered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL\nor other conditions. The main features are:\n\nLet's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:\n\nHere we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is\nequivalent to how http.HandleFunc() works: if an incoming request URL matches\none of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing\n(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) as parameters.\n\nPaths can have variables. They are defined using the format {name} or\n{name:pattern}. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched\nvariable will be anything until the next slash. For example:\n\nGroups can be used inside patterns, as long as they are non-capturing (?:re). For example:\n\nThe names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved\ncalling mux.Vars():\n\nNote that if any capturing groups are present, mux will panic() during parsing. To prevent\nthis, convert any capturing groups to non-capturing, e.g. change \"/{sort:(asc|desc)}\" to\n\"/{sort:(?:asc|desc)}\". This is a change from prior versions which behaved unpredictably\nwhen capturing groups were present.\n\nAnd this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options\nare explained below.\n\nRoutes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host\npattern to be matched. They can also have variables:\n\nThere are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:\n\n...or HTTP methods:\n\n...or URL schemes:\n\n...or header values:\n\n...or query values:\n\n...or to use a custom matcher function:\n\n...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:\n\nSetting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have\na way to group several routes that share the same requirements.\nWe call it \"subrouting\".\n\nFor example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the\nhost is \"www.example.com\". Create a route for that host and get a \"subrouter\"\nfrom it:\n\nThen register routes in the subrouter:\n\nThe three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is\n\"www.example.com\", because the subrouter is tested first. This is not\nonly convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create\nsubrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.\n\nSubrouters can be used to create domain or path \"namespaces\": you define\nsubrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its\npaths relatively to a given subrouter.\n\nThere's one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix,\nthe inner routes use it as base for their paths:\n\nNote that the path provided to PathPrefix() represents a \"wildcard\": calling\nPathPrefix(\"/static/\").Handler(...) means that the handler will be passed any\nrequest that matches \"/static/*\". This makes it easy to serve static files with mux:\n\nNow let's see how to build registered URLs.\n\nRoutes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built,\nor \"reversed\". We define a name calling Name() on a route. For example:\n\nTo build a URL, get the route and call the URL() method, passing a sequence of\nkey/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:\n\n...and the result will be a url.URL with the following path:\n\nThis also works for host and query value variables:\n\nAll variables defined in the route are required, and their values must\nconform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a\ngenerated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is\nfor explicitly defined \"build-only\" routes which never match.\n\nRegex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:\n\n...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as\n`application/text`\n\nThere's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route:\nuse the methods URLHost() or URLPath() instead.

            "description": "Package retryablehttp provides a familiar HTTP client interface with\nautomatic retries and exponential backoff. It is a thin wrapper over the\nstandard net/http client library and exposes nearly the same public API.\nThis makes retryablehttp very easy to drop into existing programs.\n\nretryablehttp performs automatic retries under certain conditions. Mainly, if\nan error is returned by the client (connection errors etc), or if a 500-range\nresponse is received, then a retry is invoked. Otherwise, the response is\nreturned and left to the caller to interpret.\n\nRequests which take a request body should provide a non-nil function\nparameter. The best choice is to provide either a function satisfying\nReaderFunc which provides multiple io.Readers in an efficient manner, a\n*bytes.Buffer (the underlying raw byte slice will be used) or a raw byte\nslice. As it is a reference type, and we will wrap it as needed by readers,\nwe can efficiently re-use the request body without needing to copy it. If an\nio.Reader (such as a *bytes.Reader) is provided, the full body will be read\nprior to the first request, and will be efficiently re-used for any retries.\nReadSeeker can be used, but some users have observed occasional data races\nbetween the net/http library and the Seek functionality of some\nimplementations of ReadSeeker, so should be avoided if possible.",

This connection can not be used for\nanything other than LISTEN / NOTIFY.  Calling Listen will open a \"notification\nchannel\"; once a notification channel is open, a notification generated on that\nchannel will effect a send on the Listener.Notify channel.  A notification\nchannel will remain open until Unlisten is called, though connection loss might\nresult in some notifications being lost.  To solve this problem, Listener sends\na nil pointer over the Notify channel any time the connection is re-established\nfollowing a connection loss.  The application can get information about the\nstate of the underlying connection by setting an event callback in the call to\nNewListener.\n\nA single Listener can safely be used from concurrent goroutines, which means\nthat there is often no need to create more than one Listener in your\napplication.  However, a Listener is always connected to a single database, so\nyou will need to create a new Listener instance for every database you want to\nreceive notifications in.\n\nThe channel name in both Listen and Unlisten is case sensitive, and can contain\nany characters legal in an identifier (see\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS\nfor more information).

            "description": "Package digest provides a generalized type to opaquely represent message\ndigests and their operations within the registry. The Digest type is\ndesigned to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.\nMore importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with\nhash.Hash-based digests with little effort.\n\nThe format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the\n\"algorithm\" and the \"digest\", separated by a colon:\n\nAn example of a sha256 digest representation follows:\n\nThe \"algorithm\" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate\nthe digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to \"hex\"\nif not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their\ndigests encoded in hex strings.\n\nIn the example above, the string \"sha256\" is the algorithm and the hex bytes\nare the \"digest\".\n\nBecause the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is\nobtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the\nstandard equality operator.\n\nThe main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a\ngiven digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash\ninterface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After\nwriting is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate\nwhether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.\n\nIn addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this\npackage:\n\n1. A Digester type that supports write sink digest calculation.\n\n2. Suspend and resume of ongoing digest calculations to support efficient digest verification in the registry.",

Remember to regenerate your bindata.go file whenever you add/modify a migration (go generate will help here, once it arrives).\n\nUse the AssetMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nBoth Asset and AssetDir are functions provided by bindata.\n\nThen proceed as usual.\n\nAdding a new migration source means implementing MigrationSource.\n\nThe resulting slice of migrations will be executed in the given order, so it should usually be sorted by the Id field.",

See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html\n\nUsage:\n\npflag is a drop-in replacement of Go's native flag package. If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash. Single dashes signify a series of shorthand\nletters for flags. All but the last shorthand letter must be boolean flags.\n\nFlag parsing stops after the terminator \"--\". Unlike the flag package,\nflags can be interspersed with arguments anywhere on the command line\nbefore this terminator.\n\nInteger flags accept 1234, 0664, 0x1234 and may be negative.\nBoolean flags (in their long form) accept 1, 0, t, f, true, false,\nTRUE, FALSE, True, False.\nDuration flags accept any input valid for time.ParseDuration.\n\nThe default set of command-line flags is controlled by\ntop-level functions.  The FlagSet type allows one to define\nindependent sets of flags, such as to implement subcommands\nin a command-line interface. The methods of FlagSet are\nanalogous to the top-level functions for the command-line\nflag set.",

You can use dot and array\nnotation too:\n\nOnce you have sought the `Value` you're interested in, you can use the `Is*` methods to determine its type.\n\nOr you can just assume the type, and use one of the strong type methods to extract the real value:\n\nIf there's no value there (or if it's the wrong type) then a default value will be returned,\nor you can be explicit about the default value.\n\nIf you're dealing with a slice of data as a value, Objx provides many useful methods for iterating,\nmanipulating and selecting that data.  You can find out more by exploring the index below.\n\nA simple example of how to use Objx:\n\nSince `objx.Map` is a `map[string]interface{}` you can treat it as such.\nFor example, to `range` the data, do what you would expect:",
