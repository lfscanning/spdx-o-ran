The primary idea\nis to let you resolve a path within a rootfs directory as if the rootfs was\na chroot.\n\nsecurejoin has two APIs, a \"legacy\" API and a \"modern\" API.\n\nThe legacy API is SecureJoin and SecureJoinVFS.

            "description": "Package restful , a lean package for creating REST-style WebServices without magic.\n\nA WebService has a collection of Route objects that dispatch incoming Http Requests to a function calls.\nTypically, a WebService has a root path (e.g. /users) and defines common MIME types for its routes.\nWebServices must be added to a container (see below) in order to handler Http requests from a server.\n\nA Route is defined by a HTTP method, an URL path and (optionally) the MIME types it consumes (Content-Type) and produces (Accept).\nThis package has the logic to find the best matching Route and if found, call its Function.\n\nThe (*Request, *Response) arguments provide functions for reading information from the request and writing information back to the response.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go with a full implementation.\n\nA Route parameter can be specified using the format \"uri/{var[:regexp]}\" or the special version \"uri/{var:*}\" for matching the tail of the path.\nFor example, /persons/{name:[A-Z][A-Z]} can be used to restrict values for the parameter \"name\" to only contain capital alphabetic characters.\nRegular expressions must use the standard Go syntax as described in the regexp package. (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\nUnexpected things happen.

            "description": "Package restful , a lean package for creating REST-style WebServices without magic.\n\nA WebService has a collection of Route objects that dispatch incoming Http Requests to a function calls.\nTypically, a WebService has a root path (e.g. /users) and defines common MIME types for its routes.\nWebServices must be added to a container (see below) in order to handler Http requests from a server.\n\nA Route is defined by a HTTP method, an URL path and (optionally) the MIME types it consumes (Content-Type) and produces (Accept).\nThis package has the logic to find the best matching Route and if found, call its Function.\n\nThe (*Request, *Response) arguments provide functions for reading information from the request and writing information back to the response.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/user-resource/restful-user-resource.go with a full implementation.\n\nA Route parameter can be specified using the format \"uri/{var[:regexp]}\" or the special version \"uri/{var:*}\" for matching the tail of the path.\nFor example, /persons/{name:[A-Z][A-Z]} can be used to restrict values for the parameter \"name\" to only contain capital alphabetic characters.\nRegular expressions must use the standard Go syntax as described in the regexp package. (https://code.google.com/p/re2/wiki/Syntax)\nThis feature requires the use of a CurlyRouter.\n\nA Container holds a collection of WebServices, Filters and a http.ServeMux for multiplexing http requests.\nUsing the statements \"restful.Add(...) and restful.Filter(...)\" will register WebServices and Filters to the Default Container.\nThe Default container of go-restful uses the http.DefaultServeMux.\nYou can create your own Container and create a new http.Server for that particular container.\n\nA filter dynamically intercepts requests and responses to transform or use the information contained in the requests or responses.\nYou can use filters to perform generic logging, measurement, authentication, redirect, set response headers etc.\nIn the restful package there are three hooks into the request,response flow where filters can be added.\nEach filter must define a FilterFunction:\n\nUse the following statement to pass the request,response pair to the next filter or RouteFunction\n\nThese are processed before any registered WebService.\n\nThese are processed before any Route of a WebService.\n\nThese are processed before calling the function associated with the Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/filters/restful-filters.go with full implementations.\n\nTwo encodings are supported: gzip and deflate. To enable this for all responses:\n\nIf a Http request includes the Accept-Encoding header then the response content will be compressed using the specified encoding.\nAlternatively, you can create a Filter that performs the encoding and install it per WebService or Route.\n\nSee the example https://github.com/emicklei/go-restful/blob/v3/examples/encoding/restful-encoding-filter.go\n\nBy installing a pre-defined container filter, your Webservice(s) can respond to the OPTIONS Http request.\n\nBy installing the filter of a CrossOriginResourceSharing (CORS), your WebService(s) can handle CORS requests.\n\nUnexpected things happen. If a request cannot be processed because of a failure, your service needs to tell via the response what happened and why.\nFor this reason HTTP status codes exist and it is important to use the correct code in every exceptional situation.\n\nIf path or query parameters are not valid (content or type) then use http.StatusBadRequest.\n\nDespite a valid URI, the resource requested may not be available\n\nIf the application logic could not process the request (or write the response) then use http.StatusInternalServerError.\n\nThe request has a valid URL but the method (GET,PUT,POST,...) is not allowed.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Accept Header set for this operation.\n\nThe request does not have or has an unknown Content-Type Header set for this operation.\n\nIn addition to setting the correct (error) Http status code, you can choose to write a ServiceError message on the response.\n\nThis package has several options that affect the performance of your service. It is important to understand them and how you can change it.\n\nDoNotRecover controls whether panics will be caught to return HTTP 500.\nIf set to false, the container will recover from panics.\nDefault value is true\n\nIf content encoding is enabled then the default strategy for getting new gzip/zlib writers and readers is to use a sync.Pool.\nBecause writers are expensive structures, performance is even more improved when using a preloaded cache. You can also inject your own implementation.\n\nThis package has the means to produce detail logging of the complete Http request matching process and filter invocation.\nEnabling this feature requires you to set an implementation of restful.StdLogger (e.g. log.Logger) instance such as:\n\nThe restful.SetLogger() method allows you to override the logger used by the package.

            "description": "Package logr defines a general-purpose logging API and abstract interfaces\nto back that API.  Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,\nwhile callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.\n\nLogging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with\nmethods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main\nmethods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()\nare key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing\n\"structured logging\".\n\nWith Go's standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr's structured logging, we'd write:\n\nErrors are much the same.  Instead of:\n\nWe'd write:\n\nInfo() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that\nLogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional\ninformation (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are\nalways logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error\ninstance available, passing nil is valid.\n\nOften we want to log information only when the application in \"verbose\nmode\".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.\nThe higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.\nLog-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not\nbe written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same\nmeaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).\nError messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.\n\nWhere we might have written:\n\nWe can write:\n\nLogger instances can have name strings so that all messages logged through\nthat instance have additional context.  For example, you might want to add\na subsystem name:\n\nThe WithName() method returns a new Logger, which can be passed to\nconstructors or other functions for further use.

Like the standard\nhttp.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of\nregistered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL\nor other conditions. The main features are:\n\nLet's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:\n\nHere we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is\nequivalent to how http.HandleFunc() works: if an incoming request URL matches\none of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing\n(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) as parameters.\n\nPaths can have variables.

This is not\nonly convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create\nsubrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.\n\nSubrouters can be used to create domain or path \"namespaces\": you define\nsubrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its\npaths relatively to a given subrouter.\n\nThere's one more thing about subroutes.

For the previous route, we would do:\n\n...and the result will be a url.URL with the following path:\n\nThis also works for host and query value variables:\n\nAll variables defined in the route are required, and their values must\nconform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a\ngenerated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is\nfor explicitly defined \"build-only\" routes which never match.\n\nRegex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:\n\n...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as\n`application/text`\n\nThere's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route:\nuse the methods URLHost() or URLPath() instead. For the previous route,\nwe would do:\n\nAnd if you use subrouters, host and path defined separately can be built\nas well:\n\nMux supports the addition of middlewares to a Router, which are executed in the order they are added if a match is found, including its subrouters.

I apologize for any issue caused by its previous behavior and any future bug that Mergo could cause in existing projects after the change (release 0.2.0).\n\nDo your usual installation procedure:\n\nYou can only merge same-type structs with exported fields initialized as zero value of their type and same-types maps. Mergo won't merge unexported (private) fields but will do recursively any exported one. It won't merge empty structs value as they are zero values too. Also, maps will be merged recursively except for structs inside maps (because they are not addressable using Go reflection).\n\nAlso, you can merge overwriting values using the transformer WithOverride.\n\nAdditionally, you can map a map[string]interface{} to a struct (and otherwise, from struct to map), following the same restrictions as in Merge(). Keys are capitalized to find each corresponding exported field.\n\nWarning: if you map a struct to map, it won't do it recursively. Don't expect Mergo to map struct members of your struct as map[string]interface{}. They will be just assigned as values.\n\nHere is a nice example:\n\nTransformers allow to merge specific types differently than in the default behavior. In other words, now you can customize how some types are merged. For example, time.Time is a struct; it doesn't have zero value but IsZero can return true because it has fields with zero value. How can we merge a non-zero time.Time?\n\nIf I can help you, you have an idea or you are using Mergo in your projects, don't hesitate to drop me a line (or a pull request): https://twitter.com/im_dario\n\nWritten by Dario Casta\u00f1\u00e9: https://da.rio.hn\n\nBSD 3-Clause license, as Go language.",

The errors package allows\nprogrammers to add context to the failure path in their code in a way\nthat does not destroy the original value of the error.\n\nThe errors.Wrap function returns a new error that adds context to the\noriginal error by recording a stack trace at the point Wrap is called,\ntogether with the supplied message. For example\n\nIf additional control is required, the errors.WithStack and\nerrors.WithMessage functions destructure errors.Wrap into its component\noperations: annotating an error with a stack trace and with a message,\nrespectively.\n\nUsing errors.Wrap constructs a stack of errors, adding context to the\npreceding error. Depending on the nature of the error it may be necessary\nto reverse the operation of errors.Wrap to retrieve the original error\nfor inspection. Any error value which implements this interface\n\ncan be inspected by errors.Cause. errors.Cause will recursively retrieve\nthe topmost error that does not implement causer, which is assumed to be\nthe original cause. For example:\n\nAlthough the causer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nAll error values returned from this package implement fmt.Formatter and can\nbe formatted by the fmt package. The following verbs are supported:\n\nNew, Errorf, Wrap, and Wrapf record a stack trace at the point they are\ninvoked. This information can be retrieved with the following interface:\n\nThe returned errors.StackTrace type is defined as\n\nThe Frame type represents a call site in the stack trace. Frame supports\nthe fmt.Formatter interface that can be used for printing information about\nthe stack trace of this error. For example:\n\nAlthough the stackTracer interface is not exported by this package, it is\nconsidered a part of its stable public interface.\n\nSee the documentation for Frame.Format for more details.",

The hex variant of base32 is used to retain the\nsortable property of the id.\n\nXid doesn't use base64 because case sensitivity and the 2 non alphanum chars may be an\nissue when transported as a string between various systems.

            "description": "SQL Schema migration tool for Go.\n\nKey features:\n\nTo install the library and command line program, use the following:\n\nThe main command is called sql-migrate.\n\nEach command requires a configuration file (which defaults to dbconfig.yml, but can be specified with the -config flag). This config file should specify one or more environments:\n\nThe `table` setting is optional and will default to `gorp_migrations`.\n\nThe environment that will be used can be specified with the -env flag (defaults to development).\n\nUse the --help flag in combination with any of the commands to get an overview of its usage:\n\nThe up command applies all available migrations. By contrast, down will only apply one migration by default. This behavior can be changed for both by using the -limit parameter.\n\nThe redo command will unapply the last migration and reapply it. This is useful during development, when you're writing migrations.\n\nUse the status command to see the state of the applied migrations:\n\nIf you are using MySQL, you must append ?parseTime=true to the datasource configuration. For example:\n\nSee https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#parsetime for more information.\n\nImport sql-migrate into your application:\n\nSet up a source of migrations, this can be from memory, from a set of files or from bindata (more on that later):\n\nThen use the Exec function to upgrade your database:\n\nNote that n can be greater than 0 even if there is an error: any migration that succeeded will remain applied even if a later one fails.\n\nThe full set of capabilities can be found in the API docs below.\n\nMigrations are defined in SQL files, which contain a set of SQL statements. Special comments are used to distinguish up and down migrations.\n\nYou can put multiple statements in each block, as long as you end them with a semicolon (;).\n\nIf you have complex statements which contain semicolons, use StatementBegin and StatementEnd to indicate boundaries:\n\nThe order in which migrations are applied is defined through the filename: sql-migrate will sort migrations based on their name. It's recommended to use an increasing version number or a timestamp as the first part of the filename.\n\nNormally each migration is run within a transaction in order to guarantee that it is fully atomic. However some SQL commands (for example creating an index concurrently in PostgreSQL) cannot be executed inside a transaction. In order to execute such a command in a migration, the migration can be run using the notransaction option:\n\nIf you like your Go applications self-contained (that is: a single binary): use packr (https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr) to embed the migration files.\n\nJust write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.\n\nUse the PackrMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nIf you already have a box and would like to use a subdirectory:\n\nAs an alternative, but slightly less maintained, you can use bindata (https://github.com/shuLhan/go-bindata) to embed the migration files.\n\nJust write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.\n\nThen use bindata to generate a .go file with the migrations embedded:\n\nThe resulting bindata.go file will contain your migrations. Remember to regenerate your bindata.go file whenever you add/modify a migration (go generate will help here, once it arrives).\n\nUse the AssetMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nBoth Asset and AssetDir are functions provided by bindata.\n\nThen proceed as usual.\n\nAdding a new migration source means implementing MigrationSource.\n\nThe resulting slice of migrations will be executed in the given order, so it should usually be sorted by the Id field.",

            "description": "Package pflag is a drop-in replacement for Go's flag package, implementing\nPOSIX/GNU-style --flags.\n\npflag is compatible with the GNU extensions to the POSIX recommendations\nfor command-line options. See\nhttp://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argument-Syntax.html\n\nUsage:\n\npflag is a drop-in replacement of Go's native flag package. If you import\npflag under the name \"flag\" then all code should continue to function\nwith no changes.\n\nThere is one exception to this: if you directly instantiate the Flag struct\nthere is one more field \"Shorthand\" that you will need to set.\nMost code never instantiates this struct directly, and instead uses\nfunctions such as String(), BoolVar(), and Var(), and is therefore\nunaffected.\n\nDefine flags using flag.String(), Bool(), Int(), etc.\n\nThis declares an integer flag, -flagname, stored in the pointer ip, with type *int.\n\nIf you like, you can bind the flag to a variable using the Var() functions.\n\nOr you can create custom flags that satisfy the Value interface (with\npointer receivers) and couple them to flag parsing by\n\nFor such flags, the default value is just the initial value of the variable.\n\nAfter all flags are defined, call\n\nto parse the command line into the defined flags.\n\nFlags may then be used directly. If you're using the flags themselves,\nthey are all pointers; if you bind to variables, they're values.\n\nAfter parsing, the arguments after the flag are available as the\nslice flag.Args() or individually as flag.Arg(i).\nThe arguments are indexed from 0 through flag.NArg()-1.\n\nThe pflag package also defines some new functions that are not in flag,\nthat give one-letter shorthands for flags. You can use these by appending\n'P' to the name of any function that defines a flag.\n\nShorthand letters can be used with single dashes on the command line.\nBoolean shorthand flags can be combined with other shorthand flags.\n\nCommand line flag syntax:\n\nUnlike the flag package, a single dash before an option means something\ndifferent than a double dash.
