See https://pkg.go.dev/cloud.google.com/go#section-directories for a\nfull list of sub-modules.\n\nAll clients in sub-packages are configurable via client options. These options\nare described here: https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option.\n\nEndpoint configuration is used to specify the URL to which requests are\nsent. It is used for services that support or require regional endpoints, as\nwell as for other use cases such as testing against fake servers.\n\nFor example, the Vertex AI service recommends that you configure the endpoint to\nthe location with the features you want that is closest to your physical\nlocation or the location of your users. There is no global endpoint for Vertex\nAI. See Vertex AI - Locations for more details. The following example\ndemonstrates configuring a Vertex AI client with a regional endpoint:\n\nAll of the clients support authentication via Google Application Default Credentials,\nor by providing a JSON key file for a Service Account. See examples below.\n\nGoogle Application Default Credentials (ADC) is the recommended way to authorize\nand authenticate clients. For information on how to create and obtain\nApplication Default Credentials, see\nhttps://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production. If you have your\nenvironment configured correctly you will not need to pass any extra information\nto the client libraries. Here is an example of a client using ADC to\nauthenticate:\n\nYou can use a file with credentials to authenticate and authorize, such as a\nJSON key file associated with a Google service account. Service Account keys can\nbe created and downloaded from https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts.\nThis example uses the Secret Manger client, but the same steps apply to the\nall other client libraries this package as well. Example:\n\nIn some cases (for instance, you don't want to store secrets on disk), you can\ncreate credentials from in-memory JSON and use the WithCredentials option.\nThis example uses the Secret Manager client, but the same steps apply to\nall other client libraries as well. Note that scopes can be\nfound at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes, and\nare also provided in all auto-generated libraries: for example,\ncloud.google.com/go/secretmanager/apiv1 provides DefaultAuthScopes. Example:\n\nBy default, non-streaming methods, like Create or Get, will have a default\ndeadline applied to the context provided at call time, unless a context deadline\nis already set. Streaming methods have no default deadline and will run\nindefinitely. To set timeouts or arrange for cancellation, use\ncontext. Transient errors will be retried when correctness allows.\n\nHere is an example of setting a timeout for an RPC using\ncontext.WithTimeout:\n\nHere is an example of setting a timeout for an RPC using\ngithub.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2.WithTimeout:\n\nHere is an example of how to arrange for an RPC to be canceled, use\ncontext.WithCancel:\n\nDo not attempt to control the initial connection (dialing) of a service by\nsetting a timeout on the context passed to NewClient. Dialing is non-blocking,\nso timeouts would be ineffective and would only interfere with credential\nrefreshing, which uses the same context.\n\nRegardless of which transport is used, request headers can be set in the same\nway using [`callctx.SetHeaders`]setheaders.\n\nHere is a generic example:\n\nThere are a some header keys that Google reserves for internal use that must\nnot be ovewritten. The following header keys are broadly considered reserved\nand should not be conveyed by client library users unless instructed to do so:\n\n* `x-goog-api-client`\n* `x-goog-request-params`\n\nBe sure to check the individual package documentation for other service-specific\nreserved headers. For example, Storage supports a specific auditing header that\nis mentioned in that [module's documentation]storagedocs.\n\nGoogle Cloud services respect system parameterssystem parameters that can be\nused to augment request and/or response behavior. For the most part, they are\nnot needed when using one of the enclosed client libraries. However, those that\nmay be necessary are made available via the [`callctx`]callctx package. If not\npresent there, consider opening an issue on that repo to request a new constant.\n\nConnection pooling differs in clients based on their transport. Cloud\nclients either rely on HTTP or gRPC transports to communicate\nwith Google Cloud.\n\nCloud clients that use HTTP rely on the underlying HTTP transport to cache\nconnections for later re-use. These are cached to the http.MaxIdleConns\nand http.MaxIdleConnsPerHost settings in http.DefaultTransport by default.\n\nFor gRPC clients, connection pooling is configurable. Users of Cloud Client\nLibraries may specify google.golang.org/api/option.WithGRPCConnectionPool\nas a client option to NewClient calls. This configures the underlying gRPC\nconnections to be pooled and accessed in a round robin fashion.\n\nMinimal container images like Alpine lack CA certificates. This causes RPCs to\nappear to hang, because gRPC retries indefinitely. See\nhttps://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/928 for more information.\n\nFor tips on how to write tests against code that calls into our libraries check\nout our Debugging Guide.\n\nFor tips on how to write tests against code that calls into our libraries check\nout our Testing Guide.\n\nMost of the errors returned by the generated clients are wrapped in an\ngithub.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2/apierror.APIError and can be further unwrapped\ninto a google.golang.org/grpc/status.Status or\ngoogle.golang.org/api/googleapi.Error depending on the transport used to make\nthe call (gRPC or REST). Converting your errors to these types can be a useful\nway to get more information about what went wrong while debugging.\n\nAPIError gives access to specific details in the error. The transport-specific\nerrors can still be unwrapped using the APIError.\n\nSemver is used to communicate stability of the sub-modules of this package.\nNote, some stable sub-modules do contain packages, and sometimes features, that\nare considered unstable. If something is unstable it will be explicitly labeled\nas such. Example of package does in an unstable package:\n\nClients that contain alpha and beta in their import path may change or go away\nwithout notice.\n\nClients marked stable will maintain compatibility with future versions for as\nlong as we can reasonably sustain.

            "description": "Package template implements data-driven templates for generating textual output.\n\nTo generate HTML output, see package html/template, which has the same interface\nas this package but automatically secures HTML output against certain attacks.\n\nTemplates are executed by applying them to a data structure. Annotations in the\ntemplate refer to elements of the data structure (typically a field of a struct\nor a key in a map) to control execution and derive values to be displayed.\nExecution of the template walks the structure and sets the cursor, represented\nby a period '.' and called \"dot\", to the value at the current location in the\nstructure as execution proceeds.\n\nThe input text for a template is UTF-8-encoded text in any format.\n\"Actions\"--data evaluations or control structures--are delimited by\n\"{{\" and \"}}\"; all text outside actions is copied to the output unchanged.\nActions may not span newlines, although comments can.\n\nOnce parsed, a template may be executed safely in parallel.\n\nHere is a trivial example that prints \"17 items are made of wool\".\n\nMore intricate examples appear below.\n\nHere is the list of actions. \"Arguments\" and \"pipelines\" are evaluations of\ndata, defined in detail below.\n\nAn argument is a simple value, denoted by one of the following.\n\nArguments may evaluate to any type; if they are pointers the implementation\nautomatically indirects to the base type when required.\nIf an evaluation yields a function value, such as a function-valued\nfield of a struct, the function is not invoked automatically, but it\ncan be used as a truth value for an if action and the like. To invoke\nit, use the call function, defined below.\n\nA pipeline is a possibly chained sequence of \"commands\". A command is a simple\nvalue (argument) or a function or method call, possibly with multiple arguments:\n\nA pipeline may be \"chained\" by separating a sequence of commands with pipeline\ncharacters '|'. In a chained pipeline, the result of the each command is\npassed as the last argument of the following command. The output of the final\ncommand in the pipeline is the value of the pipeline.\n\nThe output of a command will be either one value or two values, the second of\nwhich has type error. If that second value is present and evaluates to\nnon-nil, execution terminates and the error is returned to the caller of\nExecute.\n\nA pipeline inside an action may initialize a variable to capture the result.\nThe initialization has syntax\n\nwhere $variable is the name of the variable. An action that declares a\nvariable produces no output.\n\nIf a \"range\" action initializes a variable, the variable is set to the\nsuccessive elements of the iteration.  Also, a \"range\" may declare two\nvariables, separated by a comma:\n\nin which case $index and $element are set to the successive values of the\narray/slice index or map key and element, respectively.  Note that if there is\nonly one variable, it is assigned the element; this is opposite to the\nconvention in Go range clauses.\n\nA variable's scope extends to the \"end\" action of the control structure (\"if\",\n\"with\", or \"range\") in which it is declared, or to the end of the template if\nthere is no such control structure.  A template invocation does not inherit\nvariables from the point of its invocation.\n\nWhen execution begins, $ is set to the data argument passed to Execute, that is,\nto the starting value of dot.\n\nHere are some example one-line templates demonstrating pipelines and variables.\nAll produce the quoted word \"output\":\n\nDuring execution functions are found in two function maps: first in the\ntemplate, then in the global function map. By default, no functions are defined\nin the template but the Funcs method can be used to add them.\n\nPredefined global functions are named as follows.\n\nThe boolean functions take any zero value to be false and a non-zero\nvalue to be true.\n\nThere is also a set of binary comparison operators defined as\nfunctions:\n\nFor simpler multi-way equality tests, eq (only) accepts two or more\narguments and compares the second and subsequent to the first,\nreturning in effect\n\n(Unlike with || in Go, however, eq is a function call and all the\narguments will be evaluated.)\n\nThe comparison functions work on basic types only (or named basic\ntypes, such as \"type Celsius float32\"). They implement the Go rules\nfor comparison of values, except that size and exact type are\nignored, so any integer value, signed or unsigned, may be compared\nwith any other integer value. (The arithmetic value is compared,\nnot the bit pattern, so all negative integers are less than all\nunsigned integers.) However, as usual, one may not compare an int\nwith a float32 and so on.\n\nEach template is named by a string specified when it is created. Also, each\ntemplate is associated with zero or more other templates that it may invoke by\nname; such associations are transitive and form a name space of templates.\n\nA template may use a template invocation to instantiate another associated\ntemplate; see the explanation of the \"template\" action above. The name must be\nthat of a template associated with the template that contains the invocation.\n\nWhen parsing a template, another template may be defined and associated with the\ntemplate being parsed. Template definitions must appear at the top level of the\ntemplate, much like global variables in a Go program.\n\nThe syntax of such definitions is to surround each template declaration with a\n\"define\" and \"end\" action.\n\nThe define action names the template being created by providing a string\nconstant. Here is a simple example:\n\nThis defines two templates, T1 and T2, and a third T3 that invokes the other two\nwhen it is executed. Finally it invokes T3.

            "description": "Package template implements data-driven templates for generating textual output.\n\nTo generate HTML output, see package html/template, which has the same interface\nas this package but automatically secures HTML output against certain attacks.\n\nTemplates are executed by applying them to a data structure. Annotations in the\ntemplate refer to elements of the data structure (typically a field of a struct\nor a key in a map) to control execution and derive values to be displayed.\nExecution of the template walks the structure and sets the cursor, represented\nby a period '.' and called \"dot\", to the value at the current location in the\nstructure as execution proceeds.\n\nThe input text for a template is UTF-8-encoded text in any format.\n\"Actions\"--data evaluations or control structures--are delimited by\n\"{{\" and \"}}\"; all text outside actions is copied to the output unchanged.\nActions may not span newlines, although comments can.\n\nOnce parsed, a template may be executed safely in parallel.\n\nHere is a trivial example that prints \"17 items are made of wool\".\n\nMore intricate examples appear below.\n\nHere is the list of actions. \"Arguments\" and \"pipelines\" are evaluations of\ndata, defined in detail below.\n\nAn argument is a simple value, denoted by one of the following.\n\nArguments may evaluate to any type; if they are pointers the implementation\nautomatically indirects to the base type when required.\nIf an evaluation yields a function value, such as a function-valued\nfield of a struct, the function is not invoked automatically, but it\ncan be used as a truth value for an if action and the like. To invoke\nit, use the call function, defined below.\n\nA pipeline is a possibly chained sequence of \"commands\". A command is a simple\nvalue (argument) or a function or method call, possibly with multiple arguments:\n\nA pipeline may be \"chained\" by separating a sequence of commands with pipeline\ncharacters '|'. In a chained pipeline, the result of the each command is\npassed as the last argument of the following command. The output of the final\ncommand in the pipeline is the value of the pipeline.\n\nThe output of a command will be either one value or two values, the second of\nwhich has type error. If that second value is present and evaluates to\nnon-nil, execution terminates and the error is returned to the caller of\nExecute.\n\nA pipeline inside an action may initialize a variable to capture the result.\nThe initialization has syntax\n\nwhere $variable is the name of the variable. An action that declares a\nvariable produces no output.\n\nIf a \"range\" action initializes a variable, the variable is set to the\nsuccessive elements of the iteration.  Also, a \"range\" may declare two\nvariables, separated by a comma:\n\nin which case $index and $element are set to the successive values of the\narray/slice index or map key and element, respectively.  Note that if there is\nonly one variable, it is assigned the element; this is opposite to the\nconvention in Go range clauses.\n\nA variable's scope extends to the \"end\" action of the control structure (\"if\",\n\"with\", or \"range\") in which it is declared, or to the end of the template if\nthere is no such control structure.  A template invocation does not inherit\nvariables from the point of its invocation.\n\nWhen execution begins, $ is set to the data argument passed to Execute, that is,\nto the starting value of dot.\n\nHere are some example one-line templates demonstrating pipelines and variables.\nAll produce the quoted word \"output\":\n\nDuring execution functions are found in two function maps: first in the\ntemplate, then in the global function map. By default, no functions are defined\nin the template but the Funcs method can be used to add them.\n\nPredefined global functions are named as follows.\n\nThe boolean functions take any zero value to be false and a non-zero\nvalue to be true.\n\nThere is also a set of binary comparison operators defined as\nfunctions:\n\nFor simpler multi-way equality tests, eq (only) accepts two or more\narguments and compares the second and subsequent to the first,\nreturning in effect\n\n(Unlike with || in Go, however, eq is a function call and all the\narguments will be evaluated.)\n\nThe comparison functions work on basic types only (or named basic\ntypes, such as \"type Celsius float32\"). They implement the Go rules\nfor comparison of values, except that size and exact type are\nignored, so any integer value, signed or unsigned, may be compared\nwith any other integer value. (The arithmetic value is compared,\nnot the bit pattern, so all negative integers are less than all\nunsigned integers.) However, as usual, one may not compare an int\nwith a float32 and so on.\n\nEach template is named by a string specified when it is created. Also, each\ntemplate is associated with zero or more other templates that it may invoke by\nname; such associations are transitive and form a name space of templates.\n\nA template may use a template invocation to instantiate another associated\ntemplate; see the explanation of the \"template\" action above. The name must be\nthat of a template associated with the template that contains the invocation.\n\nWhen parsing a template, another template may be defined and associated with the\ntemplate being parsed. Template definitions must appear at the top level of the\ntemplate, much like global variables in a Go program.\n\nThe syntax of such definitions is to surround each template declaration with a\n\"define\" and \"end\" action.\n\nThe define action names the template being created by providing a string\nconstant. Here is a simple example:\n\nThis defines two templates, T1 and T2, and a third T3 that invokes the other two\nwhen it is executed. Finally it invokes T3. If executed this template will\nproduce the text\n\nBy construction, a template may reside in only one association. If it's\nnecessary to have a template addressable from multiple associations, the\ntemplate definition must be parsed multiple times to create distinct *Template\nvalues, or must be copied with the Clone or AddParseTree method.\n\nParse may be called multiple times to assemble the various associated templates;\nsee the ParseFiles and ParseGlob functions and methods for simple ways to parse\nrelated templates stored in files.\n\nA template may be executed directly or through ExecuteTemplate, which executes\nan associated template identified by name. To invoke our example above, we\nmight write,\n\nor to invoke a particular template explicitly by name,",

Like the standard\nhttp.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of\nregistered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL\nor other conditions. The main features are:\n\nLet's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:\n\nHere we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers.

For example:\n\nThe names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved\ncalling mux.Vars():\n\nNote that if any capturing groups are present, mux will panic() during parsing.

This is a change from prior versions which behaved unpredictably\nwhen capturing groups were present.\n\nAnd this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options\nare explained below.\n\nRoutes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host\npattern to be matched. They can also have variables:\n\nThere are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:\n\n...or HTTP methods:\n\n...or URL schemes:\n\n...or header values:\n\n...or query values:\n\n...or to use a custom matcher function:\n\n...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:\n\nSetting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have\na way to group several routes that share the same requirements.\nWe call it \"subrouting\".\n\nFor example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the\nhost is \"www.example.com\". Create a route for that host and get a \"subrouter\"\nfrom it:\n\nThen register routes in the subrouter:\n\nThe three URL paths we registered above will only be tested if the domain is\n\"www.example.com\", because the subrouter is tested first. This is not\nonly convenient, but also optimizes request matching. You can create\nsubrouters combining any attribute matchers accepted by a route.\n\nSubrouters can be used to create domain or path \"namespaces\": you define\nsubrouters in a central place and then parts of the app can register its\npaths relatively to a given subrouter.\n\nThere's one more thing about subroutes. When a subrouter has a path prefix,\nthe inner routes use it as base for their paths:\n\nNote that the path provided to PathPrefix() represents a \"wildcard\": calling\nPathPrefix(\"/static/\").Handler(...) means that the handler will be passed any\nrequest that matches \"/static/*\". This makes it easy to serve static files with mux:\n\nNow let's see how to build registered URLs.\n\nRoutes can be named. All routes that define a name can have their URLs built,\nor \"reversed\". We define a name calling Name() on a route. For example:\n\nTo build a URL, get the route and call the URL() method, passing a sequence of\nkey/value pairs for the route variables. For the previous route, we would do:\n\n...and the result will be a url.URL with the following path:\n\nThis also works for host and query value variables:\n\nAll variables defined in the route are required, and their values must\nconform to the corresponding patterns. These requirements guarantee that a\ngenerated URL will always match a registered route -- the only exception is\nfor explicitly defined \"build-only\" routes which never match.\n\nRegex support also exists for matching Headers within a route. For example, we could do:\n\n...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as\n`application/text`\n\nThere's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route:\nuse the methods URLHost() or URLPath() instead. For the previous route,\nwe would do:\n\nAnd if you use subrouters, host and path defined separately can be built\nas well:\n\nMux supports the addition of middlewares to a Router, which are executed in the order they are added if a match is found, including its subrouters. Middlewares are (typically) small pieces of code which take one request, do something with it, and pass it down to another middleware or the final handler. Some common use cases for middleware are request logging, header manipulation, or ResponseWriter hijacking.\n\nTypically, the returned handler is a closure which does something with the http.ResponseWriter and http.Request passed to it, and then calls the handler passed as parameter to the MiddlewareFunc (closures can access variables from the context where they are created).\n\nA very basic middleware which logs the URI of the request being handled could be written as:\n\nMiddlewares can be added to a router using `Router.Use()`:\n\nA more complex authentication middleware, which maps session token to users, could be written as:\n\nNote: The handler chain will be stopped if your middleware doesn't call `next.ServeHTTP()` with the corresponding parameters. This can be used to abort a request if the middleware writer wants to.",

            "description": "Package mux implements a request router and dispatcher.\n\nThe name mux stands for \"HTTP request multiplexer\". Like the standard\nhttp.ServeMux, mux.Router matches incoming requests against a list of\nregistered routes and calls a handler for the route that matches the URL\nor other conditions. The main features are:\n\nLet's start registering a couple of URL paths and handlers:\n\nHere we register three routes mapping URL paths to handlers. This is\nequivalent to how http.HandleFunc() works: if an incoming request URL matches\none of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing\n(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) as parameters.\n\nPaths can have variables. They are defined using the format {name} or\n{name:pattern}. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched\nvariable will be anything until the next slash. For example:\n\nGroups can be used inside patterns, as long as they are non-capturing (?:re). For example:\n\nThe names are used to create a map of route variables which can be retrieved\ncalling mux.Vars():\n\nNote that if any capturing groups are present, mux will panic() during parsing. To prevent\nthis, convert any capturing groups to non-capturing, e.g. change \"/{sort:(asc|desc)}\" to\n\"/{sort:(?:asc|desc)}\". This is a change from prior versions which behaved unpredictably\nwhen capturing groups were present.\n\nAnd this is all you need to know about the basic usage. More advanced options\nare explained below.\n\nRoutes can also be restricted to a domain or subdomain. Just define a host\npattern to be matched. They can also have variables:\n\nThere are several other matchers that can be added. To match path prefixes:\n\n...or HTTP methods:\n\n...or URL schemes:\n\n...or header values:\n\n...or query values:\n\n...or to use a custom matcher function:\n\n...and finally, it is possible to combine several matchers in a single route:\n\nSetting the same matching conditions again and again can be boring, so we have\na way to group several routes that share the same requirements.\nWe call it \"subrouting\".\n\nFor example, let's say we have several URLs that should only match when the\nhost is \"www.example.com\".

            "description": "Package websocket implements the WebSocket protocol defined in RFC 6455.\n\nThe Conn type represents a WebSocket connection. A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size. Buffers larger\nthan the largest message do not provide any benefit.\n\nDepending on the distribution of message sizes, setting the buffer size to\na value less than the maximum expected message size can greatly reduce memory\nuse with a small impact on performance. Here's an example: If 99% of the\nmessages are smaller than 256 bytes and the maximum message size is 512\nbytes, then a buffer size of 256 bytes will result in 1.01 more system calls\nthan a buffer size of 512 bytes. The memory savings is 50%.\n\nA write buffer pool is useful when the application has a modest number\nwrites over a large number of connections. when buffers are pooled, a larger\nbuffer size has a reduced impact on total memory use and has the benefit of\nreducing system calls and frame overhead.\n\nPer message compression extensions (RFC 7692) are experimentally supported\nby this package in a limited capacity. Setting the EnableCompression option\nto true in Dialer or Upgrader will attempt to negotiate per message deflate\nsupport.\n\nIf compression was successfully negotiated with the connection's peer, any\nmessage received in compressed form will be automatically decompressed.\nAll Read methods will return uncompressed bytes.\n\nPer message compression of messages written to a connection can be enabled\nor disabled by calling the corresponding Conn method:\n\nCurrently this package does not support compression with \"context takeover\".\nThis means that messages must be compressed and decompressed in isolation,\nwithout retaining sliding window or dictionary state across messages. For\nmore details refer to RFC 7692.\n\nUse of compression is experimental and may result in decreased performance.",

            "description": "Package flags provides an extensive command line option parser.\nThe flags package is similar in functionality to the go built-in flag package\nbut provides more options and uses reflection to provide a convenient and\nsuccinct way of specifying command line options.\n\nThe following features are supported in go-flags:\n\nAdditional features specific to Windows:\n\nThe flags package uses structs, reflection and struct field tags\nto allow users to specify command line options. This results in very simple\nand concise specification of your application options. For example:\n\nThis specifies one option with a short name -v and a long name --verbose.\nWhen either -v or --verbose is found on the command line, a 'true' value\nwill be appended to the Verbose field. e.g. when specifying -vvv, the\nresulting value of Verbose will be {[true, true, true]}.\n\nSlice options work exactly the same as primitive type options, except that\nwhenever the option is encountered, a value is appended to the slice.\n\nMap options from string to primitive type are also supported. On the command\nline, you specify the value for such an option as key:value. For example\n\nThen, the AuthorInfo map can be filled with something like\n-a name:Jesse -a \"surname:van den Kieboom\".\n\nFinally, for full control over the conversion between command line argument\nvalues and options, user defined types can choose to implement the Marshaler\nand Unmarshaler interfaces.\n\nThe following is a list of tags for struct fields supported by go-flags:\n\nEither the `short:` tag or the `long:` must be specified to make the field eligible as an\noption.\n\nOption groups are a simple way to semantically separate your options. All\noptions in a particular group are shown together in the help under the name\nof the group. Namespaces can be used to specify option long names more\nprecisely and emphasize the options affiliation to their group.\n\nThere are currently three ways to specify option groups.\n\nThe flags package also has basic support for commands. Commands are often\nused in monolithic applications that support various commands or actions.\nTake git for example, all of the add, commit, checkout, etc. are called\ncommands. Using commands you can easily separate multiple functions of your\napplication.\n\nThere are currently two ways to specify a command.\n\nThe most common, idiomatic way to implement commands is to define a global\nparser instance and implement each command in a separate file. These\ncommand files should define a go init function which calls AddCommand on\nthe global parser.\n\nWhen parsing ends and there is an active command and that command implements\nthe Commander interface, then its Execute method will be run with the\nremaining command line arguments.\n\nCommand structs can have options which become valid to parse after the\ncommand has been specified on the command line, in addition to the options\nof all the parent commands. I.e. considering a -v flag on the parser and an\nadd command, the following are equivalent:\n\nHowever, if the -v flag is defined on the add command, then the first of\nthe two examples above would fail since the -v flag is not defined before\nthe add command.\n\ngo-flags has builtin support to provide bash completion of flags, commands\nand argument values. To use completion, the binary which uses go-flags\ncan be invoked in a special environment to list completion of the current\ncommand line argument. It should be noted that this `executes` your application,\nand it is up to the user to make sure there are no negative side effects (for\nexample from init functions).\n\nSetting the environment variable `GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION=1` enables completion\nby replacing the argument parsing routine with the completion routine which\noutputs completions for the passed arguments. The basic invocation to\ncomplete a set of arguments is therefore:\n\nwhere `completion-example` is the binary, `arg1` and `arg2` are\nthe current arguments, and `arg3` (the last argument) is the argument\nto be completed. If the GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set to \"verbose\", then\ndescriptions of possible completion items will also be shown, if there\nare more than 1 completion items.\n\nTo use this with bash completion, a simple file can be written which\ncalls the binary which supports go-flags completion:\n\nCompletion requires the parser option PassDoubleDash and is therefore enforced if the environment variable GO_FLAGS_COMPLETION is set.\n\nCustomized completion for argument values is supported by implementing\nthe flags.Completer interface for the argument value type. An example\nof a type which does so is the flags.Filename type, an alias of string\nallowing simple filename completion. A slice or array argument value\nwhose element type implements flags.Completer will also be completed.",

Unicode\nliterals can be used in UTF-8 encoded properties files but\naren't necessary.\n\nTo load a single properties file use MustLoadFile():\n\nTo load multiple properties files use MustLoadFiles()\nwhich loads the files in the given order and merges the\nresult. Missing properties files can be ignored if the\n'ignoreMissing' flag is set to true.\n\nFilenames can contain environment variables which are expanded\nbefore loading.\n\nAll of the different key/value delimiters ' ', ':' and '=' are\nsupported as well as the comment characters '!' and '#' and\nmulti-line values.\n\nProperties stores all comments preceding a key and provides\nGetComments() and SetComments() methods to retrieve and\nupdate them. The convenience functions GetComment() and\nSetComment() allow access to the last comment. The\nWriteComment() method writes properties files including\nthe comments and with the keys in the original order.\nThis can be used for sanitizing properties files.\n\nProperty expansion is recursive and circular references\nand malformed expressions are not allowed and cause an\nerror. Expansion of environment variables is supported.\n\nThe default property expansion format is ${key} but can be\nchanged by setting different pre- and postfix values on the\nProperties object.\n\nProperties provides convenience functions for getting typed\nvalues with default values if the key does not exist or the\ntype conversion failed.\n\nAs an alternative properties may be applied with the standard\nlibrary's flag implementation at any time.\n\nProperties provides several MustXXX() convenience functions\nwhich will terminate the app if an error occurs.

            "description": "Package mapstructure exposes functionality to convert one arbitrary\nGo type into another, typically to convert a map[string]interface{}\ninto a native Go structure.\n\nThe Go structure can be arbitrarily complex, containing slices,\nother structs, etc. and the decoder will properly decode nested\nmaps and so on into the proper structures in the native Go struct.\nSee the examples to see what the decoder is capable of.\n\nThe simplest function to start with is Decode.\n\nWhen decoding to a struct, mapstructure will use the field name by\ndefault to perform the mapping. For example, if a struct has a field\n\"Username\" then mapstructure will look for a key in the source value\nof \"username\" (case insensitive).\n\nYou can change the behavior of mapstructure by using struct tags.\nThe default struct tag that mapstructure looks for is \"mapstructure\"\nbut you can customize it using DecoderConfig.\n\nTo rename the key that mapstructure looks for, use the \"mapstructure\"\ntag and set a value directly. For example, to change the \"username\" example\nabove to \"user\":\n\nEmbedded structs are treated as if they're another field with that name.\nBy default, the two structs below are equivalent when decoding with\nmapstructure:\n\nThis would require an input that looks like below:\n\nIf your \"person\" value is NOT nested, then you can append \",squash\" to\nyour tag value and mapstructure will treat it as if the embedded struct\nwere part of the struct directly. Example:\n\nNow the following input would be accepted:\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to a map, the squash tag squashes the struct\nfields into a single map. Using the example structs from above:\n\nWill be decoded into a map:\n\nDecoderConfig has a field that changes the behavior of mapstructure\nto always squash embedded structs.\n\nIf there are any unmapped keys in the source value, mapstructure by\ndefault will silently ignore them. You can error by setting ErrorUnused\nin DecoderConfig. If you're using Metadata you can also maintain a slice\nof the unused keys.\n\nYou can also use the \",remain\" suffix on your tag to collect all unused\nvalues in a map. The field with this tag MUST be a map type and should\nprobably be a \"map[string]interface{}\" or \"map[interface{}]interface{}\".\nSee example below:\n\nGiven the input below, Other would be populated with the other\nvalues that weren't used (everything but \"name\"):\n\nWhen decoding from a struct to any other value, you may use the\n\",omitempty\" suffix on your tag to omit that value if it equates to\nthe zero value. The zero value of all types is specified in the Go\nspecification.\n\nFor example, the zero type of a numeric type is zero (\"0\"). If the struct\nfield value is zero and a numeric type, the field is empty, and it won't\nbe encoded into the destination type.\n\nSince unexported (private) struct fields cannot be set outside the package\nwhere they are defined, the decoder will simply skip them.\n\nFor this output type definition:\n\nUsing this map as input:\n\nThe following struct will be decoded:\n\nmapstructure is highly configurable. See the DecoderConfig struct\nfor other features and options that are supported.",

You can use dot and array\nnotation too:\n\nOnce you have sought the `Value` you're interested in, you can use the `Is*` methods to determine its type.\n\nOr you can just assume the type, and use one of the strong type methods to extract the real value:\n\nIf there's no value there (or if it's the wrong type) then a default value will be returned,\nor you can be explicit about the default value.\n\nIf you're dealing with a slice of data as a value, Objx provides many useful methods for iterating,\nmanipulating and selecting that data.  You can find out more by exploring the index below.\n\nA simple example of how to use Objx:\n\nSince `objx.Map` is a `map[string]interface{}` you can treat it as such.\nFor example, to `range` the data, do what you would expect:",

            "description": "Package trace provides an implementation of the tracing part of the\nOpenTelemetry API.\n\nTo participate in distributed traces a Span needs to be created for the\noperation being performed as part of a traced workflow. In its simplest form:\n\nA Tracer is unique to the instrumentation and is used to create Spans.\nInstrumentation should be designed to accept a TracerProvider from which it\ncan create its own unique Tracer. Alternatively, the registered global\nTracerProvider from the go.opentelemetry.io/otel package can be used as\na default.\n\nThis package does not conform to the standard Go versioning policy; all of its\ninterfaces may have methods added to them without a package major version bump.\nThis non-standard API evolution could surprise an uninformed implementation\nauthor. They could unknowingly build their implementation in a way that would\nresult in a runtime panic for their users that update to the new API.\n\nThe API is designed to help inform an instrumentation author about this\nnon-standard API evolution. It requires them to choose a default behavior for\nunimplemented interface methods. There are three behavior choices they can\nmake:\n\nAll interfaces in this API embed a corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded. If an author wants the default\nbehavior of their implementations to be a compilation failure, signaling to\ntheir users they need to update to the latest version of that implementation,\nthey need to embed the corresponding interface from\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/embedded in their implementation. For\nexample,\n\nIf an author wants the default behavior of their implementations to panic, they\ncan embed the API interface directly.\n\nThis option is not recommended. It will lead to publishing packages that\ncontain runtime panics when users update to newer versions of\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace, which may be done with a transitive\ndependency.\n\nFinally, an author can embed another implementation in theirs. The embedded\nimplementation will be used for methods not defined by the author. For example,\nan author who wants to default to silently dropping the call can use\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/noop:\n\nIt is strongly recommended that authors only embed\ngo.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace/noop if they choose this default behavior.\nThat implementation is the only one OpenTelemetry authors can guarantee will\nfully implement all the API interfaces when a user updates their API.",
