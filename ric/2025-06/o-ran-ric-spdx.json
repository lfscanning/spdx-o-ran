These options\nare described here: https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/option.\n\nEndpoint configuration is used to specify the URL to which requests are\nsent. It is used for services that support or require regional endpoints, as\nwell as for other use cases such as testing against fake servers.\n\nFor example, the Vertex AI service recommends that you configure the endpoint to\nthe location with the features you want that is closest to your physical\nlocation or the location of your users. There is no global endpoint for Vertex\nAI. See Vertex AI - Locations for more details. The following example\ndemonstrates configuring a Vertex AI client with a regional endpoint:\n\nAll of the clients support authentication via Google Application Default Credentials,\nor by providing a JSON key file for a Service Account. See examples below.\n\nGoogle Application Default Credentials (ADC) is the recommended way to authorize\nand authenticate clients. For information on how to create and obtain\nApplication Default Credentials, see\nhttps://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production. If you have your\nenvironment configured correctly you will not need to pass any extra information\nto the client libraries. Here is an example of a client using ADC to\nauthenticate:\n\nYou can use a file with credentials to authenticate and authorize, such as a\nJSON key file associated with a Google service account. Service Account keys can\nbe created and downloaded from https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts.\nThis example uses the Secret Manger client, but the same steps apply to the\nall other client libraries this package as well. Example:\n\nIn some cases (for instance, you don't want to store secrets on disk), you can\ncreate credentials from in-memory JSON and use the WithCredentials option.\nThis example uses the Secret Manager client, but the same steps apply to\nall other client libraries as well. Note that scopes can be\nfound at https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes, and\nare also provided in all auto-generated libraries: for example,\ncloud.google.com/go/secretmanager/apiv1 provides DefaultAuthScopes. Example:\n\nBy default, non-streaming methods, like Create or Get, will have a default\ndeadline applied to the context provided at call time, unless a context deadline\nis already set. Streaming methods have no default deadline and will run\nindefinitely. To set timeouts or arrange for cancellation, use\ncontext.

Dialing is non-blocking,\nso timeouts would be ineffective and would only interfere with credential\nrefreshing, which uses the same context.\n\nRegardless of which transport is used, request headers can be set in the same\nway using [`callctx.SetHeaders`]setheaders.\n\nHere is a generic example:\n\nThere are a some header keys that Google reserves for internal use that must\nnot be ovewritten.

For example, Storage supports a specific auditing header that\nis mentioned in that [module's documentation]storagedocs.\n\nGoogle Cloud services respect system parameterssystem parameters that can be\nused to augment request and/or response behavior. For the most part, they are\nnot needed when using one of the enclosed client libraries. However, those that\nmay be necessary are made available via the [`callctx`]callctx package. If not\npresent there, consider opening an issue on that repo to request a new constant.\n\nConnection pooling differs in clients based on their transport. Cloud\nclients either rely on HTTP or gRPC transports to communicate\nwith Google Cloud.\n\nCloud clients that use HTTP rely on the underlying HTTP transport to cache\nconnections for later re-use. These are cached to the http.MaxIdleConns\nand http.MaxIdleConnsPerHost settings in http.DefaultTransport by default.\n\nFor gRPC clients, connection pooling is configurable. Users of Cloud Client\nLibraries may specify google.golang.org/api/option.WithGRPCConnectionPool\nas a client option to NewClient calls. This configures the underlying gRPC\nconnections to be pooled and accessed in a round robin fashion.\n\nMinimal container images like Alpine lack CA certificates. This causes RPCs to\nappear to hang, because gRPC retries indefinitely.

            "description": "Package semver provides the ability to work with Semantic Versions (http://semver.org) in Go.\n\nSpecifically it provides the ability to:\n\nThere are two functions that can parse semantic versions. The `StrictNewVersion`\nfunction only parses valid version 2 semantic versions as outlined in the\nspecification. The `NewVersion` function attempts to coerce a version into a\nsemantic version and parse it. For example, if there is a leading v or a version\nlisted without all 3 parts (e.g. 1.2) it will attempt to coerce it into a valid\nsemantic version (e.g., 1.2.0). In both cases a `Version` object is returned\nthat can be sorted, compared, and used in constraints.\n\nWhen parsing a version an optional error can be returned if there is an issue\nparsing the version. For example,\n\nThe version object has methods to get the parts of the version, compare it to\nother versions, convert the version back into a string, and get the original\nstring. For more details please see the documentation\nat https://godoc.org/github.com/Masterminds/semver.\n\nA set of versions can be sorted using the `sort` package from the standard library.\nFor example,\n\nThere are two methods for comparing versions. One uses comparison methods on\n`Version` instances and the other is using Constraints. There are some important\ndifferences to notes between these two methods of comparison.\n\nThere are differences between the two methods or checking versions because the\ncomparison methods on `Version` follow the specification while comparison ranges\nare not part of the specification. Different packages and tools have taken it\nupon themselves to come up with range rules. This has resulted in differences.\nFor example, npm/js and Cargo/Rust follow similar patterns which PHP has a\ndifferent pattern for ^. The comparison features in this package follow the\nnpm/js and Cargo/Rust lead because applications using it have followed similar\npatters with their versions.\n\nChecking a version against version constraints is one of the most featureful\nparts of the package.\n\nThere are two elements to the comparisons. First, a comparison string is a list\nof comma or space separated AND comparisons. These are then separated by || (OR)\ncomparisons. For example, `\">= 1.2 < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3\"` is looking for a\ncomparison that's greater than or equal to 1.2 and less than 3.0.0 or is\ngreater than or equal to 4.2.3. This can also be written as\n`\">= 1.2, < 3.0.0 || >= 4.2.3\"`\n\nThe basic comparisons are:\n\nThere are multiple methods to handle ranges and the first is hyphens ranges.\nThese look like:\n\nThe `x`, `X`, and `*` characters can be used as a wildcard character. This works\nfor all comparison operators. When used on the `=` operator it falls\nback to the tilde operation. For example,\n\nTilde Range Comparisons (Patch)\n\nThe tilde (`~`) comparison operator is for patch level ranges when a minor\nversion is specified and major level changes when the minor number is missing.\nFor example,\n\nCaret Range Comparisons (Major)\n\nThe caret (`^`) comparison operator is for major level changes once a stable\n(1.0.0) release has occurred. Prior to a 1.0.0 release the minor versions acts\nas the API stability level. This is useful when comparisons of API versions as a\nmajor change is API breaking. For example,\n\nIn addition to testing a version against a constraint, a version can be validated\nagainst a constraint. When validation fails a slice of errors containing why a\nversion didn't meet the constraint is returned. For example,",

To invoke\nit, use the call function, defined below.\n\nA pipeline is a possibly chained sequence of \"commands\". A command is a simple\nvalue (argument) or a function or method call, possibly with multiple arguments:\n\nA pipeline may be \"chained\" by separating a sequence of commands with pipeline\ncharacters '|'. In a chained pipeline, the result of the each command is\npassed as the last argument of the following command. The output of the final\ncommand in the pipeline is the value of the pipeline.\n\nThe output of a command will be either one value or two values, the second of\nwhich has type error. If that second value is present and evaluates to\nnon-nil, execution terminates and the error is returned to the caller of\nExecute.\n\nA pipeline inside an action may initialize a variable to capture the result.\nThe initialization has syntax\n\nwhere $variable is the name of the variable. An action that declares a\nvariable produces no output.\n\nIf a \"range\" action initializes a variable, the variable is set to the\nsuccessive elements of the iteration.  Also, a \"range\" may declare two\nvariables, separated by a comma:\n\nin which case $index and $element are set to the successive values of the\narray/slice index or map key and element, respectively.  Note that if there is\nonly one variable, it is assigned the element; this is opposite to the\nconvention in Go range clauses.\n\nA variable's scope extends to the \"end\" action of the control structure (\"if\",\n\"with\", or \"range\") in which it is declared, or to the end of the template if\nthere is no such control structure.  A template invocation does not inherit\nvariables from the point of its invocation.\n\nWhen execution begins, $ is set to the data argument passed to Execute, that is,\nto the starting value of dot.\n\nHere are some example one-line templates demonstrating pipelines and variables.\nAll produce the quoted word \"output\":\n\nDuring execution functions are found in two function maps: first in the\ntemplate, then in the global function map. By default, no functions are defined\nin the template but the Funcs method can be used to add them.\n\nPredefined global functions are named as follows.\n\nThe boolean functions take any zero value to be false and a non-zero\nvalue to be true.\n\nThere is also a set of binary comparison operators defined as\nfunctions:\n\nFor simpler multi-way equality tests, eq (only) accepts two or more\narguments and compares the second and subsequent to the first,\nreturning in effect\n\n(Unlike with || in Go, however, eq is a function call and all the\narguments will be evaluated.)\n\nThe comparison functions work on basic types only (or named basic\ntypes, such as \"type Celsius float32\"). They implement the Go rules\nfor comparison of values, except that size and exact type are\nignored, so any integer value, signed or unsigned, may be compared\nwith any other integer value. (The arithmetic value is compared,\nnot the bit pattern, so all negative integers are less than all\nunsigned integers.) However, as usual, one may not compare an int\nwith a float32 and so on.\n\nEach template is named by a string specified when it is created. Also, each\ntemplate is associated with zero or more other templates that it may invoke by\nname; such associations are transitive and form a name space of templates.\n\nA template may use a template invocation to instantiate another associated\ntemplate; see the explanation of the \"template\" action above. The name must be\nthat of a template associated with the template that contains the invocation.\n\nWhen parsing a template, another template may be defined and associated with the\ntemplate being parsed. Template definitions must appear at the top level of the\ntemplate, much like global variables in a Go program.\n\nThe syntax of such definitions is to surround each template declaration with a\n\"define\" and \"end\" action.\n\nThe define action names the template being created by providing a string\nconstant. Here is a simple example:\n\nThis defines two templates, T1 and T2, and a third T3 that invokes the other two\nwhen it is executed. Finally it invokes T3. If executed this template will\nproduce the text\n\nBy construction, a template may reside in only one association. If it's\nnecessary to have a template addressable from multiple associations, the\ntemplate definition must be parsed multiple times to create distinct *Template\nvalues, or must be copied with the Clone or AddParseTree method.\n\nParse may be called multiple times to assemble the various associated templates;\nsee the ParseFiles and ParseGlob functions and methods for simple ways to parse\nrelated templates stored in files.\n\nA template may be executed directly or through ExecuteTemplate, which executes\nan associated template identified by name. To invoke our example above, we\nmight write,\n\nor to invoke a particular template explicitly by name,",

            "description": "Package securejoin implements a set of helpers to make it easier to write Go\ncode that is safe against symlink-related escape attacks. The primary idea\nis to let you resolve a path within a rootfs directory as if the rootfs was\na chroot.\n\nsecurejoin has two APIs, a \"legacy\" API and a \"modern\" API.\n\nThe legacy API is SecureJoin and SecureJoinVFS. These methods are\n**not** safe against race conditions where an attacker changes the\nfilesystem after (or during) the SecureJoin operation.\n\nThe new API is made up of OpenInRoot and MkdirAll (and derived\nfunctions). These are safe against racing attackers and have several other\nprotections that are not provided by the legacy API. There are many more\noperations that most programs expect to be able to do safely, but we do not\nprovide explicit support for them because we want to encourage users to\nswitch to [libpathrs](https://github.com/openSUSE/libpathrs) which is a\ncross-language next-generation library that is entirely designed around\noperating on paths safely.\n\nsecurejoin has been used by several container runtimes (Docker, runc,\nKubernetes, etc) for quite a few years as a de-facto standard for operating\non container filesystem paths \"safely\". However, most users still use the\nlegacy API which is unsafe against various attacks (there is a fairly long\nhistory of CVEs in dependent as a result). Users should switch to the modern\nAPI as soon as possible (or even better, switch to libpathrs).\n\nThis project was initially intended to be included in the Go standard\nlibrary, but [it was rejected](https://go.dev/issue/20126). There is now a\n[new Go proposal](https://go.dev/issue/67002) for a safe path resolution API\nthat shares some of the goals of filepath-securejoin. However, that design\nis intended to work like `openat2(RESOLVE_BENEATH)` which does not fit the\nusecase of container runtimes and most system tools.",

The API can be used in several way, pick one\nthat suits you.\n\nUse simple and default helper functions with predefined foreground colors:\n\nHowever, there are times when custom color mixes are required. Below are some\nexamples to create custom color objects and use the print functions of each\nseparate color object.\n\nYou can create PrintXxx functions to simplify even more:\n\nYou can also FprintXxx functions to pass your own io.Writer:\n\nOr create SprintXxx functions to mix strings with other non-colorized strings:\n\nWindows support is enabled by default. All Print functions work as intended.\nHowever, only for color.SprintXXX functions, user should use fmt.FprintXXX and\nset the output to color.Output:\n\nUsing with existing code is possible. Just use the Set() method to set the\nstandard output to the given parameters. That way a rewrite of an existing\ncode is not required.\n\nThere might be a case where you want to disable color output (for example to\npipe the standard output of your app to somewhere else). `Color` has support to\ndisable colors both globally and for single color definition. For example\nsuppose you have a CLI app and a `--no-color` bool flag. You can easily disable\nthe color output with:\n\nYou can also disable the color by setting the NO_COLOR environment variable to any value.\n\nIt also has support for single color definitions (local).

The matching components can then be accessed using\nchi.URLParam(). All patterns must begin with a slash.\n\nA simple named placeholder {name} matches any sequence of characters\nup to the next / or the end of the URL. Trailing slashes on paths must\nbe handled explicitly.\n\nA placeholder with a name followed by a colon allows a regular\nexpression match, for example {number:\\\\d+}. The regular expression\nsyntax is Go's normal regexp RE2 syntax, except that regular expressions\nincluding { or } are not supported, and / will never be\nmatched. An anonymous regexp pattern is allowed, using an empty string\nbefore the colon in the placeholder, such as {:\\\\d+}\n\nThe special placeholder of asterisk matches the rest of the requested\nURL. Any trailing characters in the pattern are ignored. This is the only\nplaceholder which will match / characters.\n\nExamples:",

Packages in the Go ecosystem can depend on this package,\nwhile callers can implement logging with whatever backend is appropriate.\n\nLogging is done using a Logger instance.  Logger is a concrete type with\nmethods, which defers the actual logging to a LogSink interface.  The main\nmethods of Logger are Info() and Error().  Arguments to Info() and Error()\nare key/value pairs rather than printf-style formatted strings, emphasizing\n\"structured logging\".\n\nWith Go's standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr's structured logging, we'd write:\n\nErrors are much the same.  Instead of:\n\nWe'd write:\n\nInfo() and Error() are very similar, but they are separate methods so that\nLogSink implementations can choose to do things like attach additional\ninformation (such as stack traces) on calls to Error(). Error() messages are\nalways logged, regardless of the current verbosity.  If there is no error\ninstance available, passing nil is valid.\n\nOften we want to log information only when the application in \"verbose\nmode\".  To write log lines that are more verbose, Logger has a V() method.\nThe higher the V-level of a log line, the less critical it is considered.\nLog-lines with V-levels that are not enabled (as per the LogSink) will not\nbe written.  Level V(0) is the default, and logger.V(0).Info() has the same\nmeaning as logger.Info().  Negative V-levels have the same meaning as V(0).\nError messages do not have a verbosity level and are always logged.\n\nWhere we might have written:\n\nWe can write:\n\nLogger instances can have name strings so that all messages logged through\nthat instance have additional context.  For example, you might want to add\na subsystem name:\n\nThe WithName() method returns a new Logger, which can be passed to\nconstructors or other functions for further use.  Repeated use of WithName()\nwill accumulate name \"segments\".  These name segments will be joined in some\nway by the LogSink implementation.  It is strongly recommended that name\nsegments contain simple identifiers (letters, digits, and hyphen), and do\nnot contain characters that could muddle the log output or confuse the\njoining operation (e.g. whitespace, commas, periods, slashes, brackets,\nquotes, etc).\n\nLogger instances can store any number of key/value pairs, which will be\nlogged alongside all messages logged through that instance.  For example,\nyou might want to create a Logger instance per managed object:\n\nWith the standard log package, we might write:\n\nWith logr we'd write:\n\nLogger has very few hard rules, with the goal that LogSink implementations\nmight have a lot of freedom to differentiate.  There are, however, some\nthings to consider.\n\nThe log message consists of a constant message attached to the log line.\nThis should generally be a simple description of what's occurring, and should\nnever be a format string.  Variable information can then be attached using\nnamed values.\n\nKeys are arbitrary strings, but should generally be constant values.  Values\nmay be any Go value, but how the value is formatted is determined by the\nLogSink implementation.\n\nLogger instances are meant to be passed around by value. Code that receives\nsuch a value can call its methods without having to check whether the\ninstance is ready for use.\n\nThe zero logger (= Logger{}) is identical to Discard() and discards all log\nentries.

Any given level\nin logr is represents by its inverse in zap (`zapLevel = -1*logrLevel`).\nFor example V(2) is equivalent to log level -2 in Zap, while V(1) is\nequivalent to Zap's DebugLevel.",

            "description": "Package dbus implements bindings to the D-Bus message bus system.\n\nTo use the message bus API, you first need to connect to a bus (usually the\nsession or system bus). The acquired connection then can be used to call methods\non remote objects and emit or receive signals. Using the Export method, you can\narrange D-Bus methods calls to be directly translated to method calls on a Go\nvalue.\n\nFor outgoing messages, Go types are automatically converted to the\ncorresponding D-Bus types. See the official specification at\nhttps://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#type-system for more\ninformation on the D-Bus type system. The following types are directly encoded\nas their respective D-Bus equivalents:\n\nSlices and arrays encode as ARRAYs of their element type.\n\nMaps encode as DICTs, provided that their key type can be used as a key for\na DICT.\n\nStructs other than Variant and Signature encode as a STRUCT containing their\nexported fields in order. Fields whose tags contain `dbus:\"-\"` and unexported\nfields will be skipped.\n\nPointers encode as the value they're pointed to.\n\nTypes convertible to one of the base types above will be mapped as the\nbase type.\n\nTrying to encode any other type or a slice, map or struct containing an\nunsupported type will result in an InvalidTypeError.\n\nFor incoming messages, the inverse of these rules are used, with the exception\nof STRUCTs. Incoming STRUCTS are represented as a slice of empty interfaces\ncontaining the struct fields in the correct order. The Store function can be\nused to convert such values to Go structs.\n\nHandling Unix file descriptors deserves special mention. To use them, you should\nfirst check that they are supported on a connection by calling SupportsUnixFDs.\nIf it returns true, all method of Connection will translate messages containing\nUnixFD's to messages that are accompanied by the given file descriptors with the\nUnixFD values being substituted by the correct indices. Similarly, the indices\nof incoming messages are automatically resolved. It shouldn't be necessary to use\nUnixFDIndex.",

            "description": "Package glog implements logging analogous to the Google-internal C++ INFO/ERROR/V setup.\nIt provides functions that have a name matched by regex:\n\nIf Context is present, function takes context.Context argument. The\ncontext is used to pass through the Trace Context to log sinks that can make use\nof it.\nIt is recommended to use the context variant of the functions over the non-context\nvariants if a context is available to make sure the Trace Contexts are present\nin logs.\n\nIf Depth is present, this function calls log from a different depth in the call stack.\nThis enables a callee to emit logs that use the callsite information of its caller\nor any other callers in the stack. When depth == 0, the original callee's line\ninformation is emitted. When depth > 0, depth frames are skipped in the call stack\nand the final frame is treated like the original callee to Info.\n\nIf 'f' is present, function formats according to a format specifier.\n\nThis package also provides V-style logging controlled by the -v and -vmodule=file=2 flags.\n\nBasic examples:\n\nSee the documentation for the V function for an explanation of these examples:\n\nLog output is buffered and written periodically using Flush. Programs\nshould call Flush before exiting to guarantee all log output is written.\n\nBy default, all log statements write to files in a temporary directory.\nThis package provides several flags that modify this behavior.\nAs a result, flag.Parse must be called before any logging is done.\n\nOther flags provide aids to debugging.",

Middlewares are (typically) small pieces of code which take one request, do something with it, and pass it down to another middleware or the final handler. Some common use cases for middleware are request logging, header manipulation, or ResponseWriter hijacking.\n\nTypically, the returned handler is a closure which does something with the http.ResponseWriter and http.Request passed to it, and then calls the handler passed as parameter to the MiddlewareFunc (closures can access variables from the context where they are created).\n\nA very basic middleware which logs the URI of the request being handled could be written as:\n\nMiddlewares can be added to a router using `Router.Use()`:\n\nA more complex authentication middleware, which maps session token to users, could be written as:\n\nNote: The handler chain will be stopped if your middleware doesn't call `next.ServeHTTP()` with the corresponding parameters.

This is\nequivalent to how http.HandleFunc() works: if an incoming request URL matches\none of the paths, the corresponding handler is called passing\n(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request) as parameters.\n\nPaths can have variables. They are defined using the format {name} or\n{name:pattern}. If a regular expression pattern is not defined, the matched\nvariable will be anything until the next slash.

For example, we could do:\n\n...and the route will match both requests with a Content-Type of `application/json` as well as\n`application/text`\n\nThere's also a way to build only the URL host or path for a route:\nuse the methods URLHost() or URLPath() instead.

            "description": "Package websocket implements the WebSocket protocol defined in RFC 6455.\n\nThe Conn type represents a WebSocket connection. A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network.

A server application calls\nthe Upgrader.Upgrade method from an HTTP request handler to get a *Conn:\n\nCall the connection's WriteMessage and ReadMessage methods to send and\nreceive messages as a slice of bytes. This snippet of code shows how to echo\nmessages using these methods:\n\nIn above snippet of code, p is a []byte and messageType is an int with value\nwebsocket.BinaryMessage or websocket.TextMessage.\n\nAn application can also send and receive messages using the io.WriteCloser\nand io.Reader interfaces. To send a message, call the connection NextWriter\nmethod to get an io.WriteCloser, write the message to the writer and close\nthe writer when done. To receive a message, call the connection NextReader\nmethod to get an io.Reader and read until io.EOF is returned. This snippet\nshows how to echo messages using the NextWriter and NextReader methods:\n\nThe WebSocket protocol distinguishes between text and binary data messages.\nText messages are interpreted as UTF-8 encoded text. The interpretation of\nbinary messages is left to the application.\n\nThis package uses the TextMessage and BinaryMessage integer constants to\nidentify the two data message types. The ReadMessage and NextReader methods\nreturn the type of the received message. The messageType argument to the\nWriteMessage and NextWriter methods specifies the type of a sent message.\n\nIt is the application's responsibility to ensure that text messages are\nvalid UTF-8 encoded text.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol defines three types of control messages: close, ping\nand pong. Call the connection WriteControl, WriteMessage or NextWriter\nmethods to send a control message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received close messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetCloseHandler method and by returning a *CloseError from the\nNextReader, ReadMessage or the message Read method. The default close\nhandler sends a close message to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received ping messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPingHandler method. The default ping handler sends a pong\nmessage to the peer.\n\nConnections handle received pong messages by calling the handler function\nset with the SetPongHandler method. The default pong handler does nothing.\nIf an application sends ping messages, then the application should set a\npong handler to receive the corresponding pong.\n\nThe control message handler functions are called from the NextReader,\nReadMessage and message reader Read methods. The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size.

The default close and ping\nhandlers can block these methods for a short time when the handler writes to\nthe connection.\n\nThe application must read the connection to process close, ping and pong\nmessages sent from the peer. If the application is not otherwise interested\nin messages from the peer, then the application should start a goroutine to\nread and discard messages from the peer. A simple example is:\n\nConnections support one concurrent reader and one concurrent writer.\n\nApplications are responsible for ensuring that no more than one goroutine\ncalls the write methods (NextWriter, SetWriteDeadline, WriteMessage,\nWriteJSON, EnableWriteCompression, SetCompressionLevel) concurrently and\nthat no more than one goroutine calls the read methods (NextReader,\nSetReadDeadline, ReadMessage, ReadJSON, SetPongHandler, SetPingHandler)\nconcurrently.\n\nThe Close and WriteControl methods can be called concurrently with all other\nmethods.\n\nWeb browsers allow Javascript applications to open a WebSocket connection to\nany host. It's up to the server to enforce an origin policy using the Origin\nrequest header sent by the browser.\n\nThe Upgrader calls the function specified in the CheckOrigin field to check\nthe origin. If the CheckOrigin function returns false, then the Upgrade\nmethod fails the WebSocket handshake with HTTP status 403.\n\nIf the CheckOrigin field is nil, then the Upgrader uses a safe default: fail\nthe handshake if the Origin request header is present and the Origin host is\nnot equal to the Host request header.\n\nThe deprecated package-level Upgrade function does not perform origin\nchecking. The application is responsible for checking the Origin header\nbefore calling the Upgrade function.\n\nConnections buffer network input and output to reduce the number\nof system calls when reading or writing messages.\n\nWrite buffers are also used for constructing WebSocket frames. See RFC 6455,\nSection 5 for a discussion of message framing. A WebSocket frame header is\nwritten to the network each time a write buffer is flushed to the network.\nDecreasing the size of the write buffer can increase the amount of framing\noverhead on the connection.\n\nThe buffer sizes in bytes are specified by the ReadBufferSize and\nWriteBufferSize fields in the Dialer and Upgrader. The Dialer uses a default\nsize of 4096 when a buffer size field is set to zero. The Upgrader reuses\nbuffers created by the HTTP server when a buffer size field is set to zero.\nThe HTTP server buffers have a size of 4096 at the time of this writing.\n\nThe buffer sizes do not limit the size of a message that can be read or\nwritten by a connection.\n\nBuffers are held for the lifetime of the connection by default. If the\nDialer or Upgrader WriteBufferPool field is set, then a connection holds the\nwrite buffer only when writing a message.\n\nApplications should tune the buffer sizes to balance memory use and\nperformance. Increasing the buffer size uses more memory, but can reduce the\nnumber of system calls to read or write the network. In the case of writing,\nincreasing the buffer size can reduce the number of frame headers written to\nthe network.\n\nSome guidelines for setting buffer parameters are:\n\nLimit the buffer sizes to the maximum expected message size. Buffers larger\nthan the largest message do not provide any benefit.\n\nDepending on the distribution of message sizes, setting the buffer size to\na value less than the maximum expected message size can greatly reduce memory\nuse with a small impact on performance. Here's an example: If 99% of the\nmessages are smaller than 256 bytes and the maximum message size is 512\nbytes, then a buffer size of 256 bytes will result in 1.01 more system calls\nthan a buffer size of 512 bytes. The memory savings is 50%.\n\nA write buffer pool is useful when the application has a modest number\nwrites over a large number of connections. when buffers are pooled, a larger\nbuffer size has a reduced impact on total memory use and has the benefit of\nreducing system calls and frame overhead.\n\nPer message compression extensions (RFC 7692) are experimentally supported\nby this package in a limited capacity. Setting the EnableCompression option\nto true in Dialer or Upgrader will attempt to negotiate per message deflate\nsupport.\n\nIf compression was successfully negotiated with the connection's peer, any\nmessage received in compressed form will be automatically decompressed.\nAll Read methods will return uncompressed bytes.\n\nPer message compression of messages written to a connection can be enabled\nor disabled by calling the corresponding Conn method:\n\nCurrently this package does not support compression with \"context takeover\".\nThis means that messages must be compressed and decompressed in isolation,\nwithout retaining sliding window or dictionary state across messages. For\nmore details refer to RFC 7692.\n\nUse of compression is experimental and may result in decreased performance.",

They match anything until the\nnext '/' or the path end:\n\nCatch-all parameters match anything until the path end, including the\ndirectory index (the '/' before the catch-all). Since they match anything\nuntil the end, catch-all parameters must always be the final path element.\n\nThe value of parameters is saved as a slice of the Param struct, consisting\neach of a key and a value. The slice is passed to the Handle func as a third\nparameter.\nThere are two ways to retrieve the value of a parameter:",

            "description": "Package pq is a pure Go Postgres driver for the database/sql package.\n\nIn most cases clients will use the database/sql package instead of\nusing this package directly. For example:\n\nYou can also connect to a database using a URL. For example:\n\nSimilarly to libpq, when establishing a connection using pq you are expected to\nsupply a connection string containing zero or more parameters.\nA subset of the connection parameters supported by libpq are also supported by pq.\nAdditionally, pq also lets you specify run-time parameters (such as search_path or work_mem)\ndirectly in the connection string.  This is different from libpq, which does not allow\nrun-time parameters in the connection string, instead requiring you to supply\nthem in the options parameter.\n\nFor compatibility with libpq, the following special connection parameters are\nsupported:\n\nValid values for sslmode are:\n\nSee http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING\nfor more information about connection string parameters.\n\nUse single quotes for values that contain whitespace:\n\nA backslash will escape the next character in values:\n\nNote that the connection parameter client_encoding (which sets the\ntext encoding for the connection) may be set but must be \"UTF8\",\nmatching with the same rules as Postgres. It is an error to provide\nany other value.\n\nIn addition to the parameters listed above, any run-time parameter that can be\nset at backend start time can be set in the connection string.  For more\ninformation, see\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config.html.\n\nMost environment variables as specified at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-envars.html\nsupported by libpq are also supported by pq.  If any of the environment\nvariables not supported by pq are set, pq will panic during connection\nestablishment.  Environment variables have a lower precedence than explicitly\nprovided connection parameters.\n\nThe pgpass mechanism as described in http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html\nis supported, but on Windows PGPASSFILE must be specified explicitly.\n\ndatabase/sql does not dictate any specific format for parameter\nmarkers in query strings, and pq uses the Postgres-native ordinal markers,\nas shown above. The same marker can be reused for the same parameter:\n\npq does not support the LastInsertId() method of the Result type in database/sql.\nTo return the identifier of an INSERT (or UPDATE or DELETE), use the Postgres\nRETURNING clause with a standard Query or QueryRow call:\n\nFor more details on RETURNING, see the Postgres documentation:\n\nFor additional instructions on querying see the documentation for the database/sql package.\n\nParameters pass through driver.DefaultParameterConverter before they are handled\nby this package. When the binary_parameters connection option is enabled,\n[]byte values are sent directly to the backend as data in binary format.\n\nThis package returns the following types for values from the PostgreSQL backend:\n\nAll other types are returned directly from the backend as []byte values in text format.\n\npq may return errors of type *pq.Error which can be interrogated for error details:\n\nSee the pq.Error type for details.\n\nYou can perform bulk imports by preparing a statement returned by pq.CopyIn (or\npq.CopyInSchema) in an explicit transaction (sql.Tx). The returned statement\nhandle can then be repeatedly \"executed\" to copy data into the target table.\nAfter all data has been processed you should call Exec() once with no arguments\nto flush all buffered data. Any call to Exec() might return an error which\nshould be handled appropriately, but because of the internal buffering an error\nreturned by Exec() might not be related to the data passed in the call that\nfailed.\n\nCopyIn uses COPY FROM internally. It is not possible to COPY outside of an\nexplicit transaction in pq.\n\nUsage example:\n\nPostgreSQL supports a simple publish/subscribe model over database\nconnections.  See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-notify.html\nfor more information about the general mechanism.\n\nTo start listening for notifications, you first have to open a new connection\nto the database by calling NewListener.  This connection can not be used for\nanything other than LISTEN / NOTIFY.  Calling Listen will open a \"notification\nchannel\"; once a notification channel is open, a notification generated on that\nchannel will effect a send on the Listener.Notify channel.  A notification\nchannel will remain open until Unlisten is called, though connection loss might\nresult in some notifications being lost.  To solve this problem, Listener sends\na nil pointer over the Notify channel any time the connection is re-established\nfollowing a connection loss.  The application can get information about the\nstate of the underlying connection by setting an event callback in the call to\nNewListener.\n\nA single Listener can safely be used from concurrent goroutines, which means\nthat there is often no need to create more than one Listener in your\napplication.  However, a Listener is always connected to a single database, so\nyou will need to create a new Listener instance for every database you want to\nreceive notifications in.\n\nThe channel name in both Listen and Unlisten is case sensitive, and can contain\nany characters legal in an identifier (see\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-IDENTIFIERS\nfor more information).  Note that the channel name will be truncated to 63\nbytes by the PostgreSQL server.\n\nYou can find a complete, working example of Listener usage at\nhttps://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq/example/listen.\n\nIf you need support for Kerberos authentication, add the following to your main\npackage:\n\nThis package is in a separate module so that users who don't need Kerberos\ndon't have to download unnecessary dependencies.\n\nWhen imported, additional connection string parameters are supported:",

Unicode\nliterals can be used in UTF-8 encoded properties files but\naren't necessary.\n\nTo load a single properties file use MustLoadFile():\n\nTo load multiple properties files use MustLoadFiles()\nwhich loads the files in the given order and merges the\nresult. Missing properties files can be ignored if the\n'ignoreMissing' flag is set to true.\n\nFilenames can contain environment variables which are expanded\nbefore loading.\n\nAll of the different key/value delimiters ' ', ':' and '=' are\nsupported as well as the comment characters '!' and '#' and\nmulti-line values.\n\nProperties stores all comments preceding a key and provides\nGetComments() and SetComments() methods to retrieve and\nupdate them. The convenience functions GetComment() and\nSetComment() allow access to the last comment. The\nWriteComment() method writes properties files including\nthe comments and with the keys in the original order.\nThis can be used for sanitizing properties files.\n\nProperty expansion is recursive and circular references\nand malformed expressions are not allowed and cause an\nerror. Expansion of environment variables is supported.\n\nThe default property expansion format is ${key} but can be\nchanged by setting different pre- and postfix values on the\nProperties object.\n\nProperties provides convenience functions for getting typed\nvalues with default values if the key does not exist or the\ntype conversion failed.\n\nAs an alternative properties may be applied with the standard\nlibrary's flag implementation at any time.\n\nProperties provides several MustXXX() convenience functions\nwhich will terminate the app if an error occurs. The behavior\nof the failure is configurable and the default is to call\nlog.Fatal(err). To have the MustXXX() functions panic instead\nof logging the error set a different ErrorHandler before\nyou use the Properties package.\n\nYou can also provide your own ErrorHandler function.

At minimum you should skim through the https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#getting-started chapter.\n\nGinkgo's is best paired with the Gomega matcher library: https://github.com/onsi/gomega\n\nYou can run Ginkgo specs with go test - however we recommend using the ginkgo cli.

            "description": "Package digest provides a generalized type to opaquely represent message\ndigests and their operations within the registry. The Digest type is\ndesigned to serve as a flexible identifier in a content-addressable system.\nMore importantly, it provides tools and wrappers to work with\nhash.Hash-based digests with little effort.\n\nThe format of a digest is simply a string with two parts, dubbed the\n\"algorithm\" and the \"digest\", separated by a colon:\n\nAn example of a sha256 digest representation follows:\n\nThe \"algorithm\" portion defines both the hashing algorithm used to calculate\nthe digest and the encoding of the resulting digest, which defaults to \"hex\"\nif not otherwise specified. Currently, all supported algorithms have their\ndigests encoded in hex strings.\n\nIn the example above, the string \"sha256\" is the algorithm and the hex bytes\nare the \"digest\".\n\nBecause the Digest type is simply a string, once a valid Digest is\nobtained, comparisons are cheap, quick and simple to express with the\nstandard equality operator.\n\nThe main benefit of using the Digest type is simple verification against a\ngiven digest. The Verifier interface, modeled after the stdlib hash.Hash\ninterface, provides a common write sink for digest verification. After\nwriting is complete, calling the Verifier.Verified method will indicate\nwhether or not the stream of bytes matches the target digest.\n\nIn addition to the above, we intend to add the following features to this\npackage:\n\n1. A Digester type that supports write sink digest calculation.\n\n2. Suspend and resume of ongoing digest calculations to support efficient digest verification in the registry.",

            "description": "Package uniseg implements Unicode Text Segmentation, Unicode Line Breaking, and\nstring width calculation for monospace fonts. Unicode Text Segmentation conforms\nto Unicode Standard Annex #29 (https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/) and Unicode\nLine Breaking conforms to Unicode Standard Annex #14\n(https://unicode.org/reports/tr14/).\n\nIn short, using this package, you can split a string into grapheme clusters\n(what people would usually refer to as a \"character\"), into words, and into\nsentences. Or, in its simplest case, this package allows you to count the number\nof characters in a string, especially when it contains complex characters such\nas emojis, combining characters, or characters from Asian, Arabic, Hebrew, or\nother languages. Additionally, you can use it to implement line breaking (or\n\"word wrapping\"), that is, to determine where text can be broken over to the\nnext line when the width of the line is not big enough to fit the entire text.\nFinally, you can use it to calculate the display width of a string for monospace\nfonts.\n\nIf you just want to count the number of characters in a string, you can use\nGraphemeClusterCount. If you want to determine the display width of a string,\nyou can use StringWidth. If you want to iterate over a string, you can use\nStep, StepString, or the Graphemes class (more convenient but less\nperformant). This will provide you with all information: grapheme clusters,\nword boundaries, sentence boundaries, line breaks, and monospace character\nwidths. The specialized functions FirstGraphemeCluster,\nFirstGraphemeClusterInString, FirstWord, FirstWordInString,\nFirstSentence, and FirstSentenceInString can be used if only one type of\ninformation is needed.\n\nConsider the rainbow flag emoji: \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08. On most modern systems, it appears as one\ncharacter. But its string representation actually has 14 bytes, so counting\nbytes (or using len(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\")) will not work as expected. Counting runes won't,\neither: The flag has 4 Unicode code points, thus 4 runes. The stdlib function\nutf8.RuneCountInString(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\") and len([]rune(\"\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\")) will both return 4.\n\nThe GraphemeClusterCount function will return 1 for the rainbow flag emoji.\nThe Graphemes class and a variety of functions in this package will allow you to\nsplit strings into its grapheme clusters.\n\nWord boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The most familiar\nones are selection (double-click mouse selection), cursor movement (\"move to\nnext word\" control-arrow keys), and the dialog option \"Whole Word Search\" for\nsearch and replace. This package provides methods for determining word\nboundaries.\n\nSentence boundaries are often used for triple-click or some other method of\nselecting or iterating through blocks of text that are larger than single words.\nThey are also used to determine whether words occur within the same sentence in\ndatabase queries. This package provides methods for determining sentence\nboundaries.\n\nLine breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section\nof text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page,\nwindow or other display area. This package provides methods to determine the\npositions in a string where a line must be broken, may be broken, or must not be\nbroken.\n\nMonospace width, as referred to in this package, is the width of a string in a\nmonospace font. This is commonly used in terminal user interfaces or text\ndisplays or editors that don't support proportional fonts. A width of 1\ncorresponds to a single character cell. The C function wcswidth() and its\nimplementation in other programming languages is in widespread use for the same\npurpose. However, there is no standard for the calculation of such widths, and\nthis package differs from wcswidth() in a number of ways, presumably to generate\nmore visually pleasing results.\n\nTo start, we assume that every code point has a width of 1, with the following\nexceptions:\n\nFor Hangul grapheme clusters composed of conjoining Jamo and for Regional\nIndicators (flags), all code points except the first one have a width of 0. For\ngrapheme clusters starting with an Extended Pictographic, any additional code\npoint will force a total width of 2, except if the Variation Selector-15\n(U+FE0E) is included, in which case the total width is always 1. Grapheme\nclusters ending with Variation Selector-16 (U+FE0F) have a width of 2.\n\nNote that whether these widths appear correct depends on your application's\nrender engine, to which extent it conforms to the Unicode Standard, and its\nchoice of font.",

            "description": "SQL Schema migration tool for Go.\n\nKey features:\n\nTo install the library and command line program, use the following:\n\nThe main command is called sql-migrate.\n\nEach command requires a configuration file (which defaults to dbconfig.yml, but can be specified with the -config flag). This config file should specify one or more environments:\n\nThe `table` setting is optional and will default to `gorp_migrations`.\n\nThe environment that will be used can be specified with the -env flag (defaults to development).\n\nUse the --help flag in combination with any of the commands to get an overview of its usage:\n\nThe up command applies all available migrations. By contrast, down will only apply one migration by default. This behavior can be changed for both by using the -limit parameter.\n\nThe redo command will unapply the last migration and reapply it. This is useful during development, when you're writing migrations.\n\nUse the status command to see the state of the applied migrations:\n\nIf you are using MySQL, you must append ?parseTime=true to the datasource configuration. For example:\n\nSee https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql#parsetime for more information.\n\nImport sql-migrate into your application:\n\nSet up a source of migrations, this can be from memory, from a set of files or from bindata (more on that later):\n\nThen use the Exec function to upgrade your database:\n\nNote that n can be greater than 0 even if there is an error: any migration that succeeded will remain applied even if a later one fails.\n\nThe full set of capabilities can be found in the API docs below.\n\nMigrations are defined in SQL files, which contain a set of SQL statements. Special comments are used to distinguish up and down migrations.\n\nYou can put multiple statements in each block, as long as you end them with a semicolon (;).\n\nIf you have complex statements which contain semicolons, use StatementBegin and StatementEnd to indicate boundaries:\n\nThe order in which migrations are applied is defined through the filename: sql-migrate will sort migrations based on their name. It's recommended to use an increasing version number or a timestamp as the first part of the filename.\n\nNormally each migration is run within a transaction in order to guarantee that it is fully atomic. However some SQL commands (for example creating an index concurrently in PostgreSQL) cannot be executed inside a transaction. In order to execute such a command in a migration, the migration can be run using the notransaction option:\n\nIf you like your Go applications self-contained (that is: a single binary): use packr (https://github.com/gobuffalo/packr) to embed the migration files.\n\nJust write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.\n\nUse the PackrMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nIf you already have a box and would like to use a subdirectory:\n\nAs an alternative, but slightly less maintained, you can use bindata (https://github.com/shuLhan/go-bindata) to embed the migration files.\n\nJust write your migration files as usual, as a set of SQL files in a folder.\n\nThen use bindata to generate a .go file with the migrations embedded:\n\nThe resulting bindata.go file will contain your migrations. Remember to regenerate your bindata.go file whenever you add/modify a migration (go generate will help here, once it arrives).\n\nUse the AssetMigrationSource in your application to find the migrations:\n\nBoth Asset and AssetDir are functions provided by bindata.\n\nThen proceed as usual.\n\nAdding a new migration source means implementing MigrationSource.\n\nThe resulting slice of migrations will be executed in the given order, so it should usually be sorted by the Id field.",

The\nalgorithm is specified below, so that other packages can create\ncompatible anchor names and links to those anchors.\n\nThe algorithm iterates over the input text, interpreted as UTF-8,\none Unicode code point (rune) at a time.
